Annius Verus, and he was sprung of a noble family which \\nclaimed descent from Numa, second King of Rome. Thus the most reli-\\ngious of emperors came of the blood of the most pious of early kings. His father, An-\\nnius Verus, had held high office in Rome, and his grandfather, of the same name, \\nhad been thrice Consul. Both his parents died young, but Marcus held them in lov-\\ning remembrance. On his father’s death Marcus was adopted by his grandfather, the \\nconsular Annius Verus, and there was deep love between these two. On the very first \\npage of his book Marcus gratefully declares how of his grandfather he had learned to \\nbe gentle and meek, and to refrain from all anger and passion. The Emperor Hadrian \\ndivined the fine character of the lad, whom he used to call not Verus but Verissimus, \\nmore Truthful than his own name. He advanced Marcus to equestrian rank when six \\nyears of age, and at the age of eight made him a member of the ancient Salian \\npriesthood. The boy’s aunt, Annia Galeria Faustina, was married to Antoninus Pius, \\nafterwards emperor. Hence it came about that Antoninus, having no son, adopted \\nMarcus, changing his name to that which he is known by, and betrothed him to his \\ndaughter Faustina. His education was conducted with all care. The ablest teachers \\nwere engaged for him, and he was trained in the strict doctrine of the Stoic philoso-\\nphy, which was his great delight. He was taught to dress plainly and to live simply, to \\navoid all softness and luxury. His body was trained to hardihood by wrestling, hunt-\\ning, and outdoor games; and though his constitution was weak, he showed great \\npersonal courage to encounter the fiercest boars. At the same time he was kept from \\nthe extravagancies of his day. The great excitement in Rome was the strife of the Fac-\\ntions, as they were called, in the circus. The racing drivers used to adopt one of four \\ncolours — red, blue, white, or green — and their partisans showed an eagerness in \\nsupporting them which nothing could surpass. Riot and corruption went in the train \\nof the racing chariots; and from all these things Marcus held severely aloof. \\nIn 140 Marcus was raised to the consulship, and in 145 his betrothal was consum-\\nmated by marriage. Two years later Faustina brought him a daughter; and soon after \\nthe tribunate and other imperial honours were conferred upon him. \\nAntoninus Pius died in 161, and Marcus assumed the imperial state. He at once as-\\nsociated with himself L. Ceionius Commodus, whom Antoninus had adopted as a \\nyounger son at the same time with Marcus, giving him the name of Lucius Aurelius \\nVerus. Henceforth the two are colleagues in the empire, the junior being trained as it \\nwere to succeed. No sooner was Marcus settled upon the throne than wars broke out \\non all sides. In the east, Vologeses III. of Parthia began a long-meditated revolt by de-\\nstroying a whole Roman Legion and invading Syria (162). Verus was sent off in hot \\nhaste to quell this rising; and he fulfilled his trust by plunging into drunkenness and \\ndebauchery, while the war was left to his officers. Soon after Marcus had to face a \\nmore serious danger at home in the coalition of several powerful tribes on the north-\\nern frontier. Chief among those were the Marcomanni or Marchmen, the Quadi (men-\\ntioned in this book), the Sarmatians, the Catti, the Jazyges.

After all had been \\ndone possible to allay famine and to supply pressing needs — Marcus being forced \\neven to sell the imperial jewels to find money — both emperors set forth to a struggle \\nwhich was to continue more or less during the rest of Marcus’s reign. During these \\nwars, in 169, Verus died. We have no means of following the campaigns in detail; but \\nthus much is certain, that in the end the Romans succeeded in crushing the barbar-\\nian tribes, and effecting a settlement which made the empire more secure. Marcus \\nwas himself commander-in-chief, and victory was due no less to his own ability than \\nto his wisdom in choice of lieutenants, shown conspicuously in the case of Pertinax. \\nThere were several important battles fought in these campaigns; and one of them has \\nbecome celebrated for the legend of the Thundering Legion. In a battle against the \\nQuadi in 174, the day seemed to he going in favour of the foe, when on a sudden \\narose a great storm of thunder and rain the lightning struck the barbarians with ter-\\nror, and they turned to rout. In later days this storm was said to have been sent in \\nanswer to the prayers of a legion which contained many Christians, and the name \\nThundering Legion should he given to it on this account. The title of Thundering Le-\\ngion is known at an earlier date, so this part of the story at least cannot be true; but \\nthe aid of the storm is acknowledged by one of the scenes carved on Antonine’s Col-\\numn at Rome, which commemorates these wars. \\nThe settlement made after these troubles might have been more satisfactory but for \\nan unexpected rising in the east. Avidius Cassius, an able captain who had won re-\\nnown in the Parthian wars, was at this time chief governor of the eastern provinces. \\nBy whatever means induced, he had conceived the project of proclaiming himself \\nemperor as soon as Marcus, who was then in feeble health, should die; and a report \\nhaving been conveyed to him that Marcus was dead, Cassius did as he had planned. \\nMarcus, on hearing the news, immediately patched up a peace and returned home to \\nmeet this new peril. The emperors great grief was that he must needs engage in the \\nhorrors of civil strife. He praised the qualities of Cassius, and expressed a heartfelt \\nwish that Cassius might not be driven to do himself a hurt before he should have the \\nopportunity to grant a free pardon. But before he could come to the east news had \\ncome to Cassius that the emperor still lived; his followers fell away from him, and he \\nwas assassinated. Marcus now went to the east, and while there the murderers \\nbrought the head of Cassius to him; but the emperor indignantly refused their gift, \\nnor would he admit the men to his presence. \\nOn this journey his wife, Faustina, died. At his return the emperor celebrated a tri-\\numph (176). Immediately afterwards he repaired to Germany, and took up once more \\nthe burden of war. His operations were followed by complete success; but the trou-\\nbles of late years had been too much for his constitution, at no time robust, and on \\nMarch 17, 180, he died in Pannonia. \\nThe good emperor was not spared domestic troubles. Faustina had borne him several \\nchildren, of whom he was passionately fond. Their innocent faces may still be seen in \\nmany a sculpture gallery, recalling with odd effect the dreamy countenance of their \\nfather. But they died one by one, and when Marcus came to his own end only one of \\nhis sons still lived — the weak and worthless Commodus.

Scandal has made free with the name of Faustina herself, who is ac-\\ncused not only of unfaithfulness, but of intriguing with Cassius and egging him on to \\nhis fatal rebellion, it must be admitted that these charges rest on no sure evidence; \\nand the emperor, at all events, loved her dearly, nor ever felt the slightest qualm of \\nsuspicion. \\nAs a soldier we have seen that Marcus was both capable and successful; as an ad-\\nministrator he was prudent and conscientious. Although steeped in the teachings of \\nphilosophy, he did not attempt to remodel the world on any preconceived plan. He \\ntrod the path beaten by his predecessors, seeking only to do his duty as well as he \\ncould, and to keep out corruption. He did some unwise things, it is true. To create a \\ncompeer in empire, as he did with Verus, was a dangerous innovation which could \\nonly succeed if one of the two effaced himself; and under Diocletian this very prece-\\ndent caused the Roman Empire to split into halves. He erred in his civil administra-\\ntion by too much centralising. But the strong point of his reign was the administra-\\ntion of justice. Marcus sought by-laws to protect the weak, to make the lot of the \\nslaves less hard, to stand in place of father to the fatherless. Charitable foundations \\nwere endowed for rearing and educating poor children. The provinces were protected \\nagainst oppression, and public help was given to cities or districts which might be \\nvisited by calamity. The great blot on his name, and one hard indeed to explain, is \\nhis treatment of the Christians. In his reign Justin at Rome became a martyr to his \\nfaith, and Polycarp at Smyrna, and we know of many outbreaks of fanaticism in the \\nprovinces which caused the death of the faithful. It is no excuse to plead that he \\nknew nothing about the atrocities done in his name: it was his duty to know, and if \\nhe did not he would have been the first to confess that he had failed in his duty. But \\nfrom his own tone in speaking of the Christians it is clear he knew them only from \\ncalumny; and we hear of no measures taken even to secure that they should have a \\nfair hearing. In this respect Trajan was better than he. \\nTo a thoughtful mind such a religion as that of Rome would give small satisfaction. \\nIts legends were often childish or impossible; its teaching had little to do with morali-\\nty. The Roman religion was in fact of the nature of a bargain: men paid certain sacri-\\nfices and rites, and the gods granted their favour, irrespective of right or wrong. In \\nthis case all devout souls were thrown back upon philosophy, as they had been, \\nthough to a less extent, in Greece. There were under the early empire two rival \\nschools which practically divided the field between them, Stoicism and Epicurean-\\nism. The ideal set before each was nominally much the same. The Stoics aspired to \\nthe repression of all emotion, and the Epicureans to freedom from all disturbance; \\nyet in the upshot the one has become a synonym of stubborn endurance, the other \\nfor unbridled licence. With Epicureanism we have nothing to do now; but it will be \\nworth while to sketch the history and tenets of the Stoic sect. Zeno, the founder of \\nStoicism, was born in Cyprus at some date unknown, but his life may be said rough-\\nly to be between the years 350 and 250 B.C. Cyprus has been from time immemorial \\na meeting-place of the East and West, and although we cannot grant any importance \\nto a possible strain of Phoenician blood in him (for the Phoenicians were no philoso-\\nphers), yet it is quite likely that through Asia Minor he may have come in touch with\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Safari', 'creationdate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'title': 'https:/www.maximusveritas.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations', 'author': 'Arshad Kazi', 'moddate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'source': '/content/meidtations (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 128, 'page': 5, 'page_label': '6'}, page_content=\"MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS \\nINTRODUCTION \\nMarcus Aurelius' Meditations - tr.

After many years’ study he opened his own school in a colonnade \\nin Athens called the Painted Porch, or Stoa, which gave the Stoics their name. Next \\nto Zeno, the School of the Porch owes most to Chrysippus (280–207 B.C.), who organ-\\nised Stoicism into a system. Of him it was said, \\n“But for Chrysippus, there had been no Porch.” \\nThe Stoics regarded speculation as a means to an end and that end was, as Zeno put \\nit, to live consistently (ομολογουμένως ζήν) or as it was later explained, to live in con-\\nformity with nature (ομολογουμένως τη φύσει ζήν). This conforming of the life to na-\\nture was the Stoic idea of Virtue. This dictum might easily be taken to mean that vir-\\ntue consists in yielding to each natural impulse; but that was very far from the Stoic \\nmeaning. In order to live in accord with nature, it is necessary to know what nature \\nis; and to this end a threefold division of philosophy is made — into Physics, dealing \\nwith the universe and its laws, the problems of divine government and teleology; Log-\\nic, which trains the mind to discern true from false; and Ethics, which applies the \\nknowledge thus gained and tested to practical life. \\nThe Stoic system of physics was materialism with an infusion of pantheism. In con-\\ntradiction to Plato’s view that the Ideas, or Prototypes, of phenomena alone really ex-\\nist, the Stoics held that material objects alone existed; but immanent in the material \\nuniverse was a spiritual force which acted through them, manifesting itself under \\nmany forms, as fire, aether, spirit, soul, reason, the ruling principle. \\nThe universe, then, is God, of whom the popular gods are manifestations; while leg-\\nends and myths are allegorical. The soul of man is thus an emanation from the god-\\nhead, into whom it will eventually be re-absorbed. The divine ruling principle makes \\nall things work together for good, but for the good of the whole. The highest good of \\nman is consciously to work with God for the common good, and this is the sense in \\nwhich the Stoic tried to live in accord with nature. In the individual it is virtue alone \\nwhich enables him to do this; as Providence rules the universe, so virtue in the soul \\nmust rule man. \\nIn Logic, the Stoic system is noteworthy for their theory as to the test of truth, the \\nCriterion. They compared the new-born soul to a sheet of paper ready for writing. Up-\\non this the senses write their impressions (φαντασίαι), and by experience of a num-\\nber of these the soul unconsciously conceives general notions (κοιναί έννοιαι) or an-\\nticipations (προλήψεις). When the impression was such as to be irresistible it was \\ncalled καταληπτική φαντασία, one that holds fast, or as they explained it, one proceed-\\ning from truth. Ideas and inferences artificially produced by deduction or the like \\nwere tested by this “holding perception.” \\nOf the Ethical application I have already spoken. The highest good was the virtuous \\nlife. Virtue alone is happiness, and vice is unhappiness. Carrying this theory to its \\nextreme, the Stoic said that there could be no gradations between virtue and vice, \\nthough of course each has its special manifestations. Moreover, nothing is good but \\nvirtue, and nothing but vice is bad. Those outside things which are commonly called \\ngood or bad, such as health and sickness, wealth and poverty, pleasure and pain, \\nare to him indifferent (αδιάφορα).

The ideal Wise Man is sufficient unto himself in all things (αυταρκής); \\nand knowing these truths, he will be happy even when stretched upon the rack. It is \\nprobable that no Stoic claimed for himself that he was this Wise Man, but that each \\nstrove after it as an ideal much as the Christian strives after a likeness to Christ. The \\nexaggeration in this statement was, however, so obvious, that the later Stoics were \\ndriven to make a further subdivision of things indifferent into what is preferable \\n(προηγμένα) and what is undesirable (αποπροηγμένα). They also held that for him \\nwho had not attained to the perfect wisdom, certain actions were proper (καθήκοντα). \\nThese were neither virtuous nor vicious, but, like the indifferent things, held a mid-\\ndle place. \\nTwo points in the Stoic system deserve special mention. One is a careful distinction \\nbetween things which are in our power and things which are not. Desire and dislike, \\nopinion and affection, are within the power of the will; whereas health, wealth, hon-\\nour, and other such are generally not so. The Stoic was called upon to control his \\ndesires and affections, and to guide his opinion; to bring his whole being under the \\nsway of the will or leading principle, just as the universe is guided and governed by \\ndivine Providence. This is a special application of the favourite Greek virtue of mod-\\neration (σωφροσύνη), and has also its parallel in Christian ethics. The second point is \\na strong insistence on the unity of the universe, and on man’s duty as part of a great \\nwhole. Public spirit was the most splendid political virtue of the ancient world, and it \\nis here made cosmopolitan. It is again instructive to note that Christian sages insist-\\ned on the same thing. Christians are taught that they are members of a worldwide \\nbrotherhood, where is neither Greek nor Hebrew, bond nor free and that they live \\ntheir lives as fellow-workers with God. \\nSuch is the system which underlies the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius. Some \\nknowledge of it is necessary to the right understanding of the book, but for us the \\nchief interest lies elsewhere. We do not come to Marcus Aurelius for a treatise on \\nStoicism. He is no head of a school to lay down a body of doctrine for students; he \\ndoes not even contemplate that others should read what he writes. His philosophy is \\nnot an eager intellectual inquiry, but more what we should call religious feeling. The \\nuncompromising stiffness of Zeno or Chrysippus is softened and transformed by \\npassing through a nature reverent and tolerant, gentle and free from guile; the grim \\nresignation which made life possible to the Stoic sage becomes in him almost a mood \\nof aspiration. His book records the innermost thoughts of his heart, set down to ease \\nit, with such moral maxims and reflections as may help him to bear the burden of \\nduty and the countless annoyances of a busy life. \\nIt is instructive to compare the Meditations with another famous book, the Imitation \\nof Christ. There is the same ideal of self-control in both. It should be a man’s task, \\nsays the Imitation, “to overcome himself, and every day to be stronger than himself.” \\n“In withstanding of the passions standeth very peace of heart.” “Let us set the axe to \\nthe root, that we being purged of our passions may have a peaceable mind.” To this \\nend there must be continual self-examination. “If thou may not continually gather \\nthyself together, namely sometimes do it, at least once a day, the morning or the \\nevening. In the morning purpose, in the evening discuss the manner, what thou hast \\nbeen this day, in word, work, and thought.” But while the Roman’s temper is a mod-\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Safari', 'creationdate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'title': 'https:/www.maximusveritas.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations', 'author': 'Arshad Kazi', 'moddate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'source': '/content/meidtations (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 128, 'page': 7, 'page_label': '8'}, page_content=\"MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS \\nINTRODUCTION \\nMarcus Aurelius' Meditations - tr.

The Roman scru-\\ntinises his faults with severity, but without the self-contempt which makes the Chris-\\ntian “vile in his own sight.” The Christian, like the Roman, bids “study to withdraw \\nthine heart from the love of things visible”; but it is not the busy life of duty he has in \\nmind so much as the contempt of all worldly things, and the “cutting away of all low-\\ner delectations.” Both rate men’s praise or blame at their real worthlessness; “Let not \\nthy peace,” says the Christian, “be in the mouths of men.” But it is to God’s censure \\nthe Christian appeals, the Roman to his own soul. The petty annoyances of injustice \\nor unkindness are looked on by each with the same magnanimity. “Why doth a little \\nthing said or done against thee make thee sorry? It is no new thing; it is not the first, \\nnor shall it be the last, if thou live long. At best suffer patiently, if thou canst not suf-\\nfer joyously.” The Christian should sorrow more for other men’s malice than for our \\nown wrongs; but the Roman is inclined to wash his hands of the offender. “Study to \\nbe patient in suffering and bearing other men’s defaults and all manner infirmities,” \\nsays the Christian; but the Roman would never have thought to add, “If all men were \\nperfect, what had we then to suffer of other men for God?” The virtue of suffering in \\nitself is an idea which does not meet us in the Meditations. Both alike realise that \\nman is one of a great community. “No man is sufficient to himself,” says the Chris-\\ntian; “we must bear together, help together, comfort together.” But while he sees a \\nchief importance in zeal, in exalted emotion that is, and avoidance of lukewarmness, \\nthe Roman thought mainly of the duty to be done as well as might be, and less of the \\nfeeling which should go with the doing of it. To the saint as to the emperor, the world \\nis a poor thing at best. “Verily it is a misery to live upon the earth,” says the Chris-\\ntian; few and evil are the days of man’s life, which passeth away suddenly as a shad-\\now. \\nBut there is one great difference between the two books we are considering. The Imi-\\ntation is addressed to others, the Meditations by the writer to himself. We learn noth-\\ning from the Imitation of the author’s own life, except in so far as he may be assumed \\nto have practised his own preachings; the Meditations reflect mood by mood the mind \\nof him who wrote them. In their intimacy and frankness lies their great charm. These \\nnotes are not sermons; they are not even confessions. There is always an air of self-\\nconsciousness in confessions; in such revelations there is always a danger of unctu-\\nousness or of vulgarity for the best of men. St. Augustine is not always clear of of-\\nfence, and John Bunyan himself exaggerates venial peccadilloes into heinous sins. \\nBut Marcus Aurelius is neither vulgar nor unctuous; he extenuates nothing, but \\nnothing sets down in malice. He never poses before an audience; he may not be pro-\\nfound, he is always sincere. And it is a lofty and serene soul which is here disclosed \\nbefore us.

Perhaps he has fallen short of \\nhis aim, and thus seeks to call his principles to mind, and to strengthen himself for \\nthe future. That these sayings are not mere talk is plain from the story of Avidius \\nCassius, who would have usurped his imperial throne. Thus the emperor faithfully \\ncarries out his own principle, that evil must be overcome with good. For each fault in \\nothers, Nature (says he) has given us a counteracting virtue; “as, for example, \\nagainst the unthankful, it hath given goodness and meekness, as an antidote.” \\nOne so gentle towards a foe was sure to be a good friend; and indeed his pages are \\nfull of generous gratitude to those who had served him. In his First Book he sets \\ndown to account all the debts due to his kinsfolk and teachers. To his grandfather he \\nowed his own gentle spirit, to his father shamefastness and courage; he learnt of his \\nmother to be religious and bountiful and single-minded. Rusticus did not work in \\nvain, if he showed his pupil that his life needed amending. Apollonius taught him \\nsimplicity, reasonableness, gratitude, a love of true liberty. So the list runs on; every \\none he had dealings with seems to have given him something good, a sure proof of \\nthe goodness of his nature, which thought no evil. \\nIf his was that honest and true heart which is the Christian ideal, this is the more \\nwonderful in that he lacked the faith which makes Christians strong. He could say, it \\nis true, “either there is a God, and then all is well; or if all things go by chance and \\nfortune, yet mayest thou use thine own providence in those things that concern thee \\nproperly; and then art thou well.” Or again, “We must needs grant that there is a na-\\nture that doth govern the universe.” But his own part in the scheme of things is so \\nsmall, that he does not hope for any personal happiness beyond what a serene soul \\nmay win in this mortal life. “O my soul, the time I trust will be, when thou shalt be \\ngood, simple, more open and visible, than that body by which it is enclosed”; but this \\nis said of the calm contentment with human lot which he hopes to attain, not of a \\ntime when the trammels of the body shall be cast off. For the rest, the world and its \\nfame and wealth, “all is vanity.” The gods may perhaps have a particular care for \\nhim, but their especial care is for the universe at large: thus much should suffice. \\nHis gods are better than the Stoic gods, who sit aloof from all human things, untrou-\\nbled and uncaring, but his personal hope is hardly stronger. On this point he says \\nlittle, though there are many allusions to death as the natural end; doubtless he ex-\\npected his soul one day to be absorbed into the universal soul, since nothing comes \\nout of nothing, and nothing can be annihilated. His mood is one of strenuous weari-\\nness; he does his duty as a good soldier, waiting for the sound of the trumpet which \\nshall sound the retreat; he has not that cheerful confidence which led Socrates \\nthrough a life no less noble, to a death which was to bring him into the company of \\ngods he had worshipped and men whom he had revered. \\nBut although Marcus Aurelius may have held intellectually that his soul was des-\\ntined to be absorbed, and to lose consciousness of itself, there were times when he \\nfelt, as all who hold it must sometimes feel, how unsatisfying is such a creed.

If worldly things “be but as a dream, the \\nthought is not far off that there may be an awakening to what is real. When he \\nspeaks of death as a necessary change, and points out that nothing useful and prof-\\nitable can be brought about without change, did he perhaps think of the change in a \\ncorn of wheat, which is not quickened except it die? Nature’s marvellous power of \\nrecreating out of Corruption is surely not confined to bodily things. Many of his \\nthoughts sound like far-off echoes of St. Paul; and it is strange indeed that this most \\nChristian of emperors has nothing good to say of the Christians. To him they are only \\nsectaries “violently and passionately set upon opposition.” \\nProfound as philosophy these Meditations certainly are not; but Marcus Aurelius was \\ntoo sincere not to see the essence of such things as came within his experience. An-\\ncient religions were for the most part concerned with outward things. Do the neces-\\nsary rites, and you propitiate the gods; and these rites were often trivial, sometimes \\nviolated right feeling or even morality. Even when the gods stood on the side of right-\\neousness, they were concerned with the act more than with the intent. But Marcus \\nAurelius knows that what the heart is full of, the man will do. “Such as thy thoughts \\nand ordinary cogitations are,” he says, “such will thy mind be in time.” And every \\npage of the book shows us that he knew thought was sure to issue in act. He drills \\nhis soul, as it were, in right principles, that when the time comes, it may be guided \\nby them. To wait until the emergency is to be too late. \\nHe sees also the true essence of happiness. “If happiness did consist in pleasure, \\nhow came notorious robbers, impure abominable livers, parricides, and tyrants, in so \\nlarge a measure to have their part of pleasures?” He who had all the world’s pleas-\\nures at command can write thus “A happy lot and portion is, good inclinations of the \\nsoul, good desires, good actions.” \\nBy the irony of fate this man, so gentle and good, so desirous of quiet joys and a \\nmind free from care, was set at the head of the Roman Empire when great dangers \\nthreatened from east and west. For several years he himself commanded his armies \\nin chief. In camp before the Quadi he dates the first book of his Meditations, and \\nshows how he could retire within himself amid the coarse clangour of arms. The \\npomps and glories which he despised were all his; what to most men is an ambition \\nor a dream, to him was a round of weary tasks which nothing but the stern sense of \\nduty could carry him through. And he did his work well. His wars were slow and te-\\ndious, but successful. With a statesman’s wisdom he foresaw the danger to Rome of \\nthe barbarian hordes from the north, and took measures to meet it. As it was, his \\nsettlement gave two centuries of respite to the Roman Empire; had he fulfilled the \\nplan of pushing the imperial frontiers to the Elbe, which seems to have been in his \\nmind, much more might have been accomplished. But death cut short his designs. \\nTruly a rare opportunity was given to Marcus Aurelius of showing what the mind can \\ndo in despite of circumstances.

Of him that brought me up, not to be fondly addicted to either of the two great fac-\\ntions of the coursers in the circus, called Prasini, and Veneti: nor in the amphithea-\\ntre partially to favour any of the gladiators, or fencers, as either the Parmularii, or \\nthe Secutores. Moreover, to endure labour; nor to need many things; when I have \\nanything to do, to do it myself rather than by others; not to meddle with many busi-\\nnesses; and not easily to admit of any slander. \\nIII. Of Diognetus, not to busy myself about vain things, and not easily to believe \\nthose things, which are commonly spoken, by such as take upon them to work won-\\nders, and by sorcerers, or prestidigitators, and impostors; concerning the power of \\ncharms, and their driving out of demons, or evil spirits; and the like. Not to keep \\nquails for the game; nor to be mad after such things. Not to be offended with other \\nmen’s liberty of speech, and to apply myself unto philosophy.

To Rusticus I am beholding, that I first entered into the conceit that my life want-\\ned some redress and cure. And then, that I did not fall into the ambition of ordinary \\nsophists, either to write tracts concerning the common theorems, or to exhort men \\nunto virtue and the study of philosophy by public orations; as also that I never by \\nway of ostentation did affect to show myself an active able man, for any kind of bodi-\\nly exercises. And that I gave over the study of rhetoric and poetry, and of elegant neat \\nlanguage. That I did not use to walk about the house in my long robe, nor to do any \\nsuch things. Moreover I learned of him to write letters without any affectation, or cu-\\nriosity; such as that was, which by him was written to my mother from Sinuessa: \\nand to be easy and ready to be reconciled, and well pleased again with them that had \\noffended me, as soon as any of them would be content to seek unto me again. To \\nread with diligence; not to rest satisfied with a light and superficial knowledge, nor \\nquickly to assent to things commonly spoken of: whom also I must thank that ever I \\nlighted upon Epictetus his Hypomnemata, or moral commentaries and commone-\\nfactions: which also he gave me of his own. \\nV. From Apollonius, true liberty, and unvariable steadfastness, and not to regard an-\\nything at all, though never so little, but right and reason: and always, whether in the \\nsharpest pains, or after the loss of a child, or in long diseases, to be still the same \\nman; who also was a present and visible example unto me, that it was possible for \\nthe same man to be both vehement and remiss: a man not subject to be vexed, and \\noffended with the incapacity of his scholars and auditors in his lectures and exposi-\\ntions; and a true pattern of a man who of all his good gifts and faculties, least es-\\nteemed in himself, that his excellent skill and ability to teach and persuade others \\nthe common theorems and maxims of the Stoic philosophy. Of him also I learned \\nhow to receive favours and kindnesses (as commonly they are accounted): from \\nfriends, so that I might not become obnoxious unto them, for them, nor more yield-\\ning upon occasion, than in right I ought; and yet so that I should not pass them nei-\\nther, as an unsensible and unthankful man. \\nVI. Of Sextus, mildness and the pattern of a family governed with paternal affection; \\nand a purpose to live according to nature: to be grave without affectation: to observe \\ncarefully the several dispositions of my friends, not to be offended with idiots, nor \\nunseasonably to set upon those that are carried with the vulgar opinions, with the \\ntheorems, and tenets of philosophers:4 his conversation being an example how a \\nman might accommodate himself to all men and companies; so that though his com-\\npany were sweeter and more pleasing than any flatterer’s cogging and fawning; yet \\nwas it at the same time most respected and reverenced: who also had a proper hap-\\npiness and faculty, rationally and methodically to find out, and set in order all nec-\\nessary determinations and instructions for a man’s life.

From Alexander the Grammarian, to be unreprovable myself, and not reproach-\\nfully to reprehend any man for a barbarism, or a solecism, or any false pronuncia-\\ntion, but dextrously by way of answer, or testimony, or confirmation of the same \\nmatter (taking no notice of the word) to utter it as it should have been spoken; or by \\nsome other such close and indirect admonition, handsomely and civilly to tell him of \\nit. \\nVIII. Of Fronto, to how much envy and fraud and hypocrisy the state of a tyrannous \\nking is subject unto, and how they who are commonly called ευπατρίδαι, i.e. nobly \\nborn, are in some sort incapable, or void of natural affection. \\nIX. Of Alexander the Platonic, not often nor without great necessity to say, or to write \\nto any man in a letter, “I am not at leisure”; nor in this manner still to put off those \\nduties, which we owe to our friends and acquaintances (to every one in his kind) un-\\nder pretence of urgent affairs. \\nX. Of Catulus, not to contemn any friend’s expostulation, though unjust, but to \\nstrive to reduce him to his former disposition: freely and heartily to speak well of all \\nmy masters upon any occasion, as it is reported of Domitius, and Athenodotus: and \\nto love my children with true affection. \\nXI. From my brother Severus, to be kind and loving to all them of my house and fam-\\nily; by whom also I came to the knowledge of Thrasea and Helvidius, and Cato, and \\nDio, and Brutus. He it was also that did put me in the first conceit and desire of an \\nequal commonwealth, administered by justice and equality; and of a kingdom where-\\nin should be regarded nothing more than the good and welfare of the subjects. Of \\nhim also, to observe a constant tenor, (not interrupted, with any other cares and dis-\\ntractions), in the study and esteem of philosophy: to be bountiful and liberal in the \\nlargest measure; always to hope the best; and to be confident that my friends love \\nme. In whom I moreover observed open dealing towards those whom he reproved at \\nany time, and that his friends might without all doubt or much observation know \\nwhat he would, or would not, so open and plain was he. \\nXII. From Claudius Maximus,5 in all things to endeavour to have power of myself, \\nand in nothing to be carried about; to be cheerful and courageous in all sudden \\nchances and accidents, as in sicknesses: to love mildness, and moderation, and \\ngravity: and to do my business, whatsoever it be, thoroughly, and without queru-\\nlousness. Whatsoever he said, all men believed him that as he spake, so he thought, \\nand whatsoever he did, that he did it with a good intent. His manner was, never to \\nwonder at anything; never to be in haste, and yet never slow: nor to be perplexed, or \\ndejected, or at any time unseemly, or excessively to laugh: nor to be angry, or suspi-\\ncious, but ever ready to do good, and to forgive, and to speak truth; and all this, as \\none that seemed rather of himself to have been straight and right, than ever to have \\nbeen rectified or redressed; neither was there any man that ever thought himself un-\\n                                            5 [“Claudius Maximus” (15).

He would also be very pleasant and gracious. \\nXIII. In my father, I observed his meekness; his constancy without wavering in those \\nthings, which after a due examination and deliberation, he had determined. How free \\nfrom all vanity he carried himself in matter of honour and dignity, (as they are es-\\nteemed): his laboriousness and assiduity, his readiness to hear any man, that had \\naught to say tending to any common good: how generally and impartially he would \\ngive every man his due; his skill and knowledge, when rigour or extremity, or when \\nremissness or moderation was in season; how he did abstain from all unchaste love \\nof youths; his moderate condescending to other men’s occasions as an ordinary man, \\nneither absolutely requiring of his friends, that they should wait upon him at his or-\\ndinary meals, nor that they should of necessity accompany him in his journeys; and \\nthat whensoever any business upon some necessary occasions was to be put off and \\nomitted before it could be ended, he was ever found when he went about it again, the \\nsame man that he was before. His accurate examination of things in consultations, \\nand patient hearing of others. He would not6 hastily give over the search of the mat-\\nter, as one easy to be satisfied with sudden notions and apprehensions. His care to \\npreserve his friends; how neither at any time he would carry himself towards them \\nwith disdainful neglect, and grow weary of them; nor yet at any time be madly fond of \\nthem. His contented mind in all things, his cheerful countenance, his care to foresee \\nthings afar off, and to take order for the least, without any noise or clamour. Moreo-\\nver how all acclamations and flattery were repressed by him: how carefully he ob-\\nserved all things necessary to the government, and kept an account of the common \\nexpenses, and how patiently he did abide that he was reprehended by some for this \\nhis strict and rigid kind of dealing.7 How he was neither a superstitious worshipper \\nof the gods, nor an ambitious pleaser of men, or studious of popular applause; but \\nsober in all things, and everywhere observant of that which was fitting; no affecter of \\nnovelties: in those things which conduced to his ease and convenience, (plenty \\nwhereof his fortune did afford him), without pride and bragging, yet with all freedom \\nand liberty: so that as he did freely enjoy them without any anxiety or affectation \\nwhen they were present; so when absent, he found no want of them. Moreover, that \\nhe was never commended by any man, as either a learned acute man, or an obsequi-\\nous officious man, or a fine orator; but as a ripe mature man, a perfect sound man; \\none that could not endure to be flattered; able to govern both himself and others. \\nMoreover, how much he did honour all true philosophers, without upbraiding those \\nthat were not so; his sociableness, his gracious and delightful conversation, but nev-\\ner unto satiety; his care of his body within bounds and measure, not as one that de-\\nsired to live long, or over-studious of neatness, and elegancy; and yet not as one that \\ndid not regard it: so that through his own care and providence, he seldom needed \\nany inward physic, or outward applications: but especially how ingeniously he would \\nyield to any that had obtained any peculiar faculty, as either eloquence, or the \\nknowledge of the laws, or of ancient customs, or the like; and how he concurred with \\n                                            6 [“Patient hearing. . . .

From the gods I received that I had good grandfathers, and parents, a good sis-\\nter, good masters, good domestics, loving kinsmen, almost all that I have; and that I \\nnever through haste and rashness transgressed against any of them, notwithstand-\\ning that my disposition was such, as that such a thing (if occasion had been) might \\nvery well have been committed by me, but that It was the mercy of the gods, to pre-\\nvent such a concurring of matters and occasions, as might make me to incur this \\nblame. That I was not long brought up by the concubine of my father; that I pre-\\nserved the flower of my youth. That I took not upon me to be a man before my time, \\nbut rather put it off longer than I needed. That I lived under the government of my \\nlord and father, who would take away from me all pride and vainglory, and reduce \\nme to that conceit and opinion that it was not impossible for a prince to live in the \\ncourt without a troop of guards and followers, extraordinary apparel, such and such \\ntorches and statues, and other like particulars of state and magnificence; but that a \\nman may reduce and contract himself almost to the state of a private man, and yet \\nfor all that not to become the more base and remiss in those public matters and af-\\nfairs, wherein power and authority is requisite. That I have had such a brother, who \\nby his own example might stir me up to think of myself; and by his respect and love, \\ndelight and please me. That I have got ingenuous children, and that they were not \\nborn distorted, nor with any other natural deformity.

That having been often displeased with Rus-\\nticus, I never did him anything for which afterwards I had occasion to repent. That it \\nbeing so that my mother was to die young, yet she lived with me all her latter years. \\nThat as often as I had a purpose to help and succour any that either were poor, or \\nfallen into some present necessity, I never was answered by my officers that there \\nwas not ready money enough to do it; and that I myself never had occasion to require \\nthe like succour from any other. That I have such a wife, so obedient, so loving, so \\ningenuous. That I had choice of fit and able men, to whom I might commit the bring-\\ning up of my children. That by dreams I have received help, as for other things, so in \\nparticular, how I might stay my casting of blood, and cure my dizziness, as that also \\nthat happened to thee in Cajeta,9 as unto Chryses when he prayed by the seashore. \\nAnd when I did first apply myself to philosophy, that I did not fall into the hands of \\nsome sophists, or spent my time either in reading the manifold volumes of ordinary \\nphilosophers, nor in practising myself in the solution of arguments and fallacies, nor \\ndwelt upon the studies of the meteors, and other natural curiosities.

Away with thy books, suffer not thy mind \\nany more to be distracted, and carried to and fro; for it will not be; but as even now \\nready to die, think little of thy flesh: blood, bones, and a skin; a pretty piece of knit \\nand twisted work, consisting of nerves, veins and arteries; think no more of it, than \\nso.

The third, is thy ruling part; \\nand here consider; Thou art an old man; suffer not that excellent part to be brought \\nin subjection, and to become slavish: suffer it not to be drawn up and down with un-\\nreasonable and unsociable lusts and motions, as it were with wires and nerves; suf-\\nfer it not any more, either to repine at anything now present, or to fear and fly any-\\nthing to come, which the destiny hath appointed thee. \\nXVII.

And as for the whole, it is preserved, as by the \\nperpetual mutation and conversion of the simple elements one into another, so also \\nby the mutation, and alteration of things mixed and compounded. Let these things \\nsuffice thee; let them be always unto thee, as thy general rules and precepts.

It is high time for thee to understand the true nature both \\nof the world, whereof thou art a part; and of that Lord and Governor of the world, \\nfrom whom, as a channel from the spring, thou thyself didst flow: and that there is \\nbut a certain limit of time appointed unto thee, which if thou shalt not make use of \\nto calm and allay the many distempers of thy soul, it will pass away and thou with it, \\nand never after return. \\nII. Let it be thy earnest and incessant care as a Roman and a man to perform what-\\nsoever it is that thou art about, with true and unfeigned gravity, natural affection, \\nfreedom and justice: and as for all other cares, and imaginations, how thou mayest \\nease thy mind of them. Which thou shalt do; if thou shalt go about every action as \\nthy last action, free from all vanity, all passionate and wilful aberration from reason, \\nand from all hypocrisy, and self-love, and dislike of those things, which by the fates \\nor appointment of God have happened unto thee. Thou seest that those things, \\nwhich for a man to hold on in a prosperous course, and to live a divine life, are req-\\nuisite and necessary, are not many, for the gods will require no more of any man, \\nthat shall but keep and observe these things. \\nIII. Do, soul,10 do; abuse and contemn thyself; yet a while and the time for thee to \\nrespect thyself, will be at an end. Every man’s happiness depends from himself, but \\nbehold thy life is almost at an end, whiles affording thyself no respect, thou dost \\nmake thy happiness to consist in the souls, and conceits of other men. \\nIV Why should any of these things that happen externally, so much distract thee? \\nGive thyself leisure to learn some good thing, and cease roving and wandering to and \\nfro. Thou must also take heed of another kind of wandering, for they are idle in their \\nactions, who toil and labour in this life, and have no certain scope to which to direct \\nall their motions, and desires. \\nV. For not observing the state of another man’s soul, scarce was ever any man \\nknown to be unhappy. tell whosoever they be that intend not, and guide not by rea-\\nson and discretion the motions of their own souls, they must of necessity be unhap-\\npy. \\nVI. These things thou must always have in mind: What is the nature of the universe, \\nand what is mine — in particular: This unto that what relation it hath: what kind of \\npart, of what kind of universe it is: And that there is nobody that can hinder thee, \\nbut that thou mayest always both do and speak those things which are agreeable to \\nthat nature, whereof thou art a part. \\n                                            10 [“Do, soul” (6).

Theophrastus, where he compares sin with sin (as after a vulgar sense such \\nthings I grant may be compared): says well and like a philosopher, that those sins \\nare greater which are committed through lust, than those which are committed \\nthrough anger. For he that is angry seems with a kind of grief and close contraction \\nof himself, to turn away from reason; but he that sins through lust, being overcome \\nby pleasure, doth in his very sin bewray a more impotent, and unmanlike disposi-\\ntion. Well then and like a philosopher doth he say, that he of the two is the more to \\nbe condemned, that sins with pleasure, than he that sins with grief. For indeed this \\nlatter may seem first to have been wronged, and so in some manner through grief \\nthereof to have been forced to be angry, whereas he who through lust doth commit \\nanything, did of himself merely resolve upon that action. \\nVIII. Whatsoever thou dost affect, whatsoever thou dost project, so do, and so project \\nall, as one who, for aught thou knowest, may at this very present depart out of this \\nlife. And as for death, if there be any gods, it is no grievous thing to leave the society \\nof men. The gods will do thee no hurt, thou mayest be sure. But if it be so that there \\nbe no gods, or that they take no care of the world, why should I desire to live in a \\nworld void of gods, and of all divine providence? But gods there be certainly, and they \\ntake care for the world; and as for those things which be truly evil, as vice and. wick-\\nedness, such things they have put in a man s own power, that he might avoid them if \\nhe would: and had there been anything besides that had been truly bad and evil, \\nthey would have had a care of that also, that a man might have avoided it. But why \\nshould that be thought to hurt and prejudice a man’s life in this world, which cannot \\nany ways make man himself the better, or the worse in his own person? Neither \\nmust we think that the nature of the universe did either through ignorance pass \\nthese things, or if not as ignorant of them, yet as unable either to prevent, or better \\nto order and dispose them. It cannot be that she through want either of power or \\nskill, should have committed such a thing, so as to suffer all things both good and \\nbad, equally and promiscuously, to happen unto all both good and bad. As for life \\ntherefore, and death, honour and dishonour, labour and pleasure, riches and pov-\\nerty, all these things happen unto men indeed, both good and bad, equally; but as \\nthings which of themselves are neither good nor bad; because of themselves, neither \\nshameful nor praiseworthy. \\nIX. Consider how quickly all things are dissolved and resolved: the bodies and sub-\\nstances themselves, into the matter and substance of the world: and their memories \\ninto the general age and time of the world. Consider the nature of all worldly sensible \\nthings; of those especially, which either ensnare by pleasure, or for their irksomeness \\nare dreadful, or for their outward lustre and show are in great esteem and request, \\nhow vile and contemptible, how base and corruptible, how destitute of all true life \\nand being they are. \\nX. It is the part of a man endowed with a good understanding faculty, to consider \\nwhat they themselves are in very deed, from whose bare conceits and voices, honour \\nand credit do proceed:11 as also what it is to die, and how if a man shall consider this \\nby itself alone, to die, and separate from it in his mind all those things which with it \\n                                            11 [“honour and credit do proceed” (12).

Now death, it \\nis not only a work of nature, but also conducing to nature. \\nXI. Consider12 with thyself how man, and by what part of his, is joined unto God, \\nand how that part of man is affected, when it is said to be diffused. There is nothing \\nmore wretched than that soul, which in a kind of circuit compasseth all things, \\nsearching (as he saith) even the very depths of the earth; and by all signs and conjec-\\ntures prying into the very thoughts of other men’s souls; and yet of this, is not sensi-\\nble, that it is sufficient for a man to apply himself wholly, and to confine all his \\nthoughts and cares to the tendance of that spirit which is within him, and truly and \\nreally to serve him. His service doth consist in this, that a man keep himself pure \\nfrom all violent passion and evil affection, from all rashness and vanity, and from all \\nmanner of discontent, either in regard of the gods or men. For indeed whatsoever \\nproceeds from the gods, deserves respect for their worth and excellency; and whatso-\\never proceeds from men, as they are our kinsmen, should by us be entertained, with \\nlove, always; sometimes, as proceeding from their ignorance, of that which is truly \\ngood and bad, (a blindness no less, than that by which we are not able to discern be-\\ntween white and black): with a kind of pity and compassion also. \\nXII. If thou shouldst live three thousand, or as many as ten thousands of years, yet \\nremember this, that man can part with no life properly, save with that little part of \\nlife, which he now lives: and that which he lives, is no other, than that which at every \\ninstant he parts with. That then which is longest of duration, and that which is \\nshortest, come both to one effect. For although in regard of that which is already past \\nthere may be some inequality, yet that time which is now present and in being, is \\nequal unto all men. And that being it which we part with whensoever we die, it doth \\nmanifestly appear, that it can be but a moment of time, that we then part with. For \\nas for that which is either past or to come, a man cannot be said properly to part \\nwith it. For how should a man part with that which he hath not? These two things \\ntherefore thou must remember. First, that all things in the world from all eternity, by \\na perpetual revolution of the same times and things ever continued and renewed, are \\nof one kind and nature; so that whether for a hundred or two hundred years only, or \\nfor an infinite space of time, a man see those things which are still the same, it can \\nbe no matter of great moment. And secondly, that that life which any the longest liv-\\ner, or the shortest liver parts with, is for length and duration the very same, for that \\nonly which is present, is that, which either of them can lose, as being that only \\nwhich they have; for that which he hath not, no man can truly be said to lose. \\nXIII. Remember that all is but opinion and conceit, for those things are plain and ap-\\nparent, which were spoken unto Monimus the Cynic; and as plain and apparent is \\nthe use that may be made of those things, if that which is true and serious in them, \\nbe received as well as that which is sweet and pleasing. \\nXIV. A man’s soul doth wrong and disrespect itself first and especially, when as \\nmuch as in itself lies it becomes an aposteme, and as it were an excrescency of the \\nworld, for to be grieved and displeased with anything that happens in the world, is \\n                                            12 [“Consider,” etc. (12).

The time of a man’s life is as a point; the substance of it ever flowing, the sense \\nobscure; and the whole composition of the body tending to corruption. His soul is \\nrestless, fortune uncertain, and fame doubtful; to be brief, as a stream so are all \\nthings belonging to the body; as a dream, or as a smoke, so are all that belong unto \\nthe soul. Our life is a warfare, and a mere pilgrimage. Fame after life is no better \\nthan oblivion. What is it then that will adhere and follow? Only one thing, philoso-\\nphy. And philosophy doth consist in this, for a man to preserve that spirit which is \\nwithin him, from all manner of contumelies and injuries, and above all pains or \\npleasures; never to do anything either rashly, or feignedly, or hypocritically: wholly to \\ndepend from himself and his own proper actions: all things that happen unto him to \\nembrace contentedly, as coming from Him from whom he himself also came; and \\nabove all things, with all meekness and a calm cheerfulness, to expect death, as be-\\ning nothing else but the resolution of those elements, of which every creature is com-\\nposed. And if the elements themselves suffer nothing by this their perpetual conver-\\nsion of one into another, that dissolution, and alteration, which is so common unto \\nall, why should it be feared by any? Is not this according to nature? But nothing that \\nis according to nature can be evil. \\nWhilst I was at Carnununtum.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Safari', 'creationdate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'title': 'https:/www.maximusveritas.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations', 'author': 'Arshad Kazi', 'moddate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'source': '/content/meidtations (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 128, 'page': 22, 'page_label': '23'}, page_content=\"MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS \\nTHIRD BOOK \\nMarcus Aurelius' Meditations - tr.

For if once he shall begin \\nto dote, his respiration, nutrition, his imaginative, and appetitive, and other natural \\nfaculties, may still continue the same: he shall find no want of them. But how to \\nmake that right use of himself that he should, how to observe exactly in all things \\nthat which is right and just, how to redress and rectify all wrong, or sudden appre-\\nhensions and imaginations, and even of this particular, whether he should live any \\nlonger or no, to consider duly; for all such things, wherein the best strength and vig-\\nour of the mind is most requisite; his power and ability will be past and gone.

This also thou must observe, that whatsoever it is that naturally doth happen to \\nthings natural, hath somewhat in itself that is pleasing and delightful: as a great loaf \\nwhen it is baked, some parts of it cleave as it were, and part asunder, and make the \\ncrust of it rugged and unequal, and yet those parts of it, though in some sort it be \\nagainst the art and intention of baking itself, that they are thus cleft and parted, \\nwhich should have been and were first made all even and uniform, they become it \\nwell nevertheless, and have a certain peculiar property, to stir the appetite. So figs \\nare accounted fairest and ripest then, when they begin to shrink, and wither as it \\nwere. So ripe olives, when they are next to putrefaction, then are they in their proper \\nbeauty. The hanging down of grapes, the brow of a lion, the froth of a foaming wild \\nboar, and many other like things, though by themselves considered, they are far from \\nany beauty, yet because they happen naturally, they both are comely, and delightful; \\nso that if a man shall with a profound mind and apprehension, consider all things in \\nthe world, even among all those things which are but mere accessories and natural \\nappendices as it were, there will scarce appear anything unto him, wherein he will \\nnot find matter of pleasure and delight. So will he behold with as much pleasure the \\ntrue rictus of wild beasts, as those which by skilful painters and other artificers are \\nimitated. So will he be able to perceive the proper ripeness and beauty of old age, \\nwhether in man or woman: and whatsoever else it is that is beautiful and alluring in \\nwhatsoever is, with chaste and continent eyes he will soon find out and discern. \\nThose and many other things will he discern, not credible unto every one, but unto \\nthem only who are truly and familiarly acquainted, both with nature itself, and all \\nnatural things. \\nIII.

Spend not the remnant of thy days in thoughts and fancies concerning other \\nmen, when it is not in relation to some common good, when by it thou art hindered \\nfrom some other better work. That is, spend not thy time in thinking, what such a \\nman doth, and to what end: what he saith, and what he thinks, and what he is \\nabout, and such other things or curiosities, which make a man to rove and wander \\nfrom the care and observation of that part of himself, which is rational, and overrul-\\ning. See therefore in the whole series and connection of thy thoughts, that thou be \\ncareful to prevent whatsoever is idle and impertinent: but especially, whatsoever is \\ncurious and malicious: and thou must use thyself to think only of such things, of \\nwhich if a man upon a sudden should ask thee, what it is that thou art now think-\\ning, thou mayest answer This, and That, freely and boldly, that so by thy thoughts it \\nmay presently appear that in all thee is sincere, and peaceable; as becometh one that \\nis made for society, and regards not pleasures, nor gives way to any voluptuous im-\\naginations at all: free from all contentiousness, envy, and suspicion, and from what-\\nsoever else thou wouldest blush to confess thy thoughts were set upon.

Do nothing against thy will, nor contrary to the community, nor without due ex-\\namination, nor with reluctancy. Affect not to set out thy thoughts with curious neat \\nlanguage.

To be cheerful, and to stand in no need, either of other men’s help or attendance, \\nor of that rest and tranquillity, which thou must be beholding to others for. Rather \\nlike one that is straight of himself, or hath ever been straight, than one that hath \\nbeen rectified. \\nVII. If thou shalt find anything in this mortal life better than righteousness, than \\ntruth, temperance, fortitude, and in general better than a mind contented both with \\nthose things which according to right and reason she doth, and in those, which \\nwithout her will and knowledge happen unto thee by the providence; if I say, thou \\ncanst find out anything better than this, apply thyself unto it with thy whole heart, \\nand that which is best wheresoever thou dost find it, enjoy freely. But if nothing thou \\nshalt find worthy to be preferred to that spirit which is within thee; if nothing better \\nthan to subject unto thee thine own lusts and desires, and not to give way to any \\nfancies or imaginations before thou hast duly considered of them, nothing better \\nthan to withdraw thyself (to use Socrates his words) from all sensuality, and submit \\nthyself unto the gods, and to have care of all men in general: if thou shalt find that \\nall other things in comparison of this, are but vile, and of little moment; then give not \\nway to any other thing, which being once though but affected and inclined unto, it \\nwill no more be in thy power without all distraction as thou oughtest to prefer and to \\npursue after that good, which is thine own and thy proper good. For it is not lawful, \\nthat anything that is of another and inferior kind and nature, be it what it will, as \\neither popular applause, or honour, or riches, or pleasures; should be suffered to \\nconfront and contest as it were, with that which is rational, and operatively good. For \\nall these things, if once though but for a while, they begin to please, they presently \\nprevail, and pervert a man’s mind, or turn a man from the right way. Do thou there-\\nfore I say absolutely and freely make choice of that which is best, and stick unto it. \\nNow, that they say is best, which is most profitable. If they mean profitable to man \\nas he is a rational man, stand thou to it, and maintain it; but if they mean profitable, \\nas he is a creature, only reject it; and from this thy tenet and conclusion keep off \\ncarefully all plausible shows and colours of external appearance, that thou mayest \\nbe able to discern things rightly.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Safari', 'creationdate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'title': 'https:/www.maximusveritas.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations', 'author': 'Arshad Kazi', 'moddate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'source': '/content/meidtations (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 128, 'page': 25, 'page_label': '26'}, page_content=\"MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS \\nTHIRD BOOK \\nMarcus Aurelius' Meditations - tr.

Never esteem of anything as profitable, which shall ever constrain thee either to \\nbreak thy faith, or to lose thy modesty; to hate any man, to suspect, to curse, to dis-\\nsemble, to lust after anything, that requireth the secret of walls or veils. But he that \\npreferreth before all things his rational part and spirit, and the sacred mysteries of \\nvirtue which issueth from it, he shall never lament and exclaim, never sigh; he shall \\nnever want either solitude or company: and which is chiefest of all, he shall live \\nwithout either desire or fear. And as for life, whether for a long or short time he shall \\nenjoy his soul thus compassed about with a body, he is altogether indifferent. For if \\neven now he were to depart, he is as ready for it, as for any other action, which may \\nbe performed with modesty and decency. For all his life long, this is his only care, \\nthat his mind may always be occupied in such intentions and objects, as are proper \\nto a rational sociable creature. \\nIX. In the mind that is once truly disciplined and purged, thou canst not find any-\\nthing, either foul or impure, or as it were festered: nothing that is either servile, or \\naffected: no partial tie; no malicious averseness; nothing obnoxious; nothing con-\\ncealed. The life of such an one, death can never surprise as imperfect; as of an actor, \\nthat should die before he had ended, or the play itself were at an end, a man might \\nspeak. \\nX. Use thine opinative faculty with all honour and respect, for in her indeed is all: \\nthat thy opinion do not beget in thy understanding anything contrary to either na-\\nture, or the proper constitution of a rational creature. The end and object of a ration-\\nal constitution is, to do nothing rashly, to be kindly affected towards men, and in all \\nthings willingly to submit unto the gods. Casting therefore all other things aside, \\nkeep thyself to these few, and remember withal that no man properly can be said to \\nlive more than that which is now present, which is but a moment of time. Whatsoev-\\ner is besides either is already past, or uncertain. The time therefore that any man \\ndoth live, is but a little, and the place where he liveth, is but a very little corner of the \\nearth, and the greatest fame that can remain of a man after his death, even that is \\nbut little, and that too, such as it is whilst it is, is by the succession of silly mortal \\nmen preserved, who likewise shall shortly die, and even whiles they live know not \\nwhat in very deed they themselves are: and much less can know one, who long before \\nis dead and gone. \\nXI. To these ever-present helps and mementoes, let one more be added, ever to make \\na particular description and delineation as it were of every object that presents itself \\nto thy mind, that thou mayest wholly and throughly contemplate it, in its own proper \\nnature, bare and naked; wholly, and severally; divided into its several parts and \\nquarters: and then by thyself in thy mind, to call both it, and those things of which it \\ndoth consist, and in which it shall be resolved, by their own proper true names, and \\nappellations. For there is nothing so effectual to beget true magnanimity, as to be \\nable truly and methodically to examine and consider all things that happen in this \\nlife, and so to penetrate into their natures, that at the same time, this also may con-\\ncur in our apprehensions: what is the true use of it? and what is the true nature of \\nthis universe, to which it is useful? how much in regard of the universe may it be es-\\nteemed? how much in regard of man, a citizen of the supreme city, of which all other \\ncities in the world are as it were but houses and families?\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Safari', 'creationdate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'title': 'https:/www.maximusveritas.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations', 'author': 'Arshad Kazi', 'moddate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'source': '/content/meidtations (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 128, 'page': 26, 'page_label': '27'}, page_content=\"MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS \\nTHIRD BOOK \\nMarcus Aurelius' Meditations - tr.

What is this, that now my fancy is set upon? of what things doth it consist? how \\nlong can it last? which of all the virtues is the proper virtue for this present use? as \\nwhether meekness, fortitude, truth, faith, sincerity, contentation, or any of the rest? \\nOf everything therefore thou must use thyself to say, This immediately comes from \\nGod, this by that fatal connection, and concatenation of things, or (which almost \\ncomes to one) by some coincidental casualty. And as for this, it proceeds from my \\nneighbour, my kinsman, my fellow: through his ignorance indeed, because he knows \\nnot what is truly natural unto him: but I know it, and therefore carry myself towards \\nhim according to the natural law of fellowship; that is kindly, and justly. As for those \\nthings that of themselves are altogether indifferent, as in my best judgment I con-\\nceive everything to deserve more or less, so I carry myself towards it. \\nXIII. If thou shalt intend that which is present, following the rule of right and reason \\ncarefully, solidly, meekly, and shalt not intermix any other businesses, but shall \\nstudy this only to preserve thy spirit impolluted, and pure, and shall cleave unto him \\nwithout either hope or fear of anything, in all things that thou shalt either do or \\nspeak, contenting thyself with heroical truth, thou shalt live happily; and from this, \\nthere is no man that can hinder thee. \\nXIV. As physicians and chirurgeons have always their instruments ready at hand for \\nall sudden cures; so have thou always thy dogmata in a readiness for the knowledge \\nof things, both divine and human: and whatsoever thou dost, even in the smallest \\nthings that thou dost, thou must ever remember that mutual relation, and connec-\\ntion that is between these two things divine, and things human. For without relation \\nunto God, thou shalt never speed in any worldly actions; nor on the other side in any \\ndivine, without some respect had to things human. \\nXV. Be not deceived; for thou shalt never live to read thy moral commentaries, nor \\nthe acts of the famous Romans and Grecians; nor those excerpta from several books; \\nall which thou hadst provided and laid up for thyself against thine old age. Hasten \\ntherefore to an end, and giving over all vain hopes, help thyself in time if thou carest \\nfor thyself, as thou oughtest to do. \\nXVI. To steal, to sow, to buy, to be at rest, to see what is to be done (which is not \\nseen by the eyes, but by another kind of sight): what these words mean, and how \\nmany ways to be understood, they do not understand. The body, the soul, the un-\\nderstanding. As the senses naturally belong to the body, and the desires and affec-\\ntions to the soul, so do the dogmata to the understanding. \\nXVII. To be capable of fancies and imaginations, is common to man and beast. To be \\nviolently drawn and moved by the lusts and desires of the soul, is proper to wild \\nbeasts and monsters, such as Phalaris and Nero were. To follow reason for ordinary \\nduties and actions is common to them also, who believe not that there be any gods, \\nand for their advantage would make no conscience to betray their own country; and \\nwho when once the doors be shut upon them, dare do anything. If therefore all \\nthings else be common to these likewise, it follows, that for a man to like and em-\\nbrace all things that happen and are destinated unto him, and not to trouble and \\nmolest that spirit which is seated in the temple of his own breast, with a multitude of \\nvain fancies and imaginations, but to keep him propitious and to obey him as a god,\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Safari', 'creationdate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'title': 'https:/www.maximusveritas.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations', 'author': 'Arshad Kazi', 'moddate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'source': '/content/meidtations (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 128, 'page': 27, 'page_label': '28'}, page_content=\"MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS \\nTHIRD BOOK \\nMarcus Aurelius' Meditations - tr.

They seek for themselves private retiring places, as country villages, the sea-\\nshore, mountains; yea thou thyself art wont to long much after such places. But all \\nthis thou must know proceeds from simplicity in the highest degree. At what time \\nsoever thou wilt, it is in thy power to retire into thyself, and to be at rest, and free \\nfrom all businesses. A man cannot any whither retire better than to his own soul; he \\nespecially who is beforehand provided of such things within, which whensoever he \\ndoth withdraw himself to look in, may presently afford unto him perfect ease and \\ntranquillity. By tranquillity I understand a decent orderly disposition and carriage, \\nfree from all confusion and tumultuousness. Afford then thyself this retiring contin-\\nually, and thereby refresh and renew thyself. Let these precepts be brief and funda-\\nmental, which as soon as thou dost call them to mind, may suffice thee to purge thy \\nsoul throughly, and to send thee away well pleased with those things whatsoever \\nthey be, which now again after this short withdrawing of thy soul into herself thou \\ndost return unto. For what is it that thou art offended at? Can it be at the wicked-\\nness of men, when thou dost call to mind this conclusion, that all reasonable crea-\\ntures are made one for another? and that it is part of justice to bear with them? and \\nthat it is against their wills that they offend? and how many already, who once like-\\nwise prosecuted their enmities, suspected, hated, and fiercely contended, are now \\nlong ago stretched out, and reduced unto ashes?

And as for thy body, what canst thou fear, if thou dost consider that \\nthy mind and understanding, when once it hath recollected itself, and knows its own \\npower, hath in this life and breath (whether it run smoothly and gently, or whether \\nharshly and rudely), no interest at all, but is altogether indifferent: and whatsoever \\nelse thou hast heard and assented unto concerning either pain or pleasure?

For the whole earth is but as one point; and of it, this inhabited part of it, is \\nbut a very little part; and of this part, how many in number, and what manner of \\nmen are they, that will commend thee? What remains then, but that thou often put \\nin practice this kind of retiring of thyself, to this little part of thyself; and above all \\nthings, keep thyself from distraction, and intend not anything vehemently, but be \\nfree and consider all things, as a man whose proper object is Virtue, as a man whose \\ntrue nature is to be kind and sociable, as a citizen, as a mortal creature. Among oth-\\ner things, which to consider, and look into thou must use to withdraw thyself, let \\nthose two be among the most obvious and at hand. One, that the things or objects \\nthemselves reach not unto the soul, but stand without still and quiet, and that it is \\nfrom the opinion only which is within, that all the tumult and all the trouble doth \\nproceed. The next, that all these things, which now thou seest, shall within a very \\nlittle while be changed, and be no more: and ever call to mind, how many changes \\nand alterations in the world thou thyself hast already been an eyewitness of in thy \\ntime. This world is mere change, and this life, opinion. \\nIV. If to understand and to be reasonable be common unto all men, then is that rea-\\nson, for which we are termed reasonable, common unto all. If reason is general, then \\nis that reason also, which prescribeth what is to be done and what not, common un-\\nto all. If that, then law. If law, then are we fellow-citizens. If so, then are we partners \\nin some one commonweal. If so, then the world is as it were a city. For which other \\ncommonweal is it, that all men can be said to be members of? From this common \\ncity it is, that understanding, reason, and law is derived unto us, for from whence \\nelse? For as that which in me is earthly I have from some common earth; and that \\nwhich is moist from some other element is imparted; as my breath and life hath its \\nproper fountain; and that likewise which is dry and fiery in me: (for there is nothing \\nwhich doth not proceed from something; as also there is nothing that can be reduced \\nunto mere nothing): so also is there some common beginning from whence my un-\\nderstanding bath proceeded. \\nV. As generation is, so also death, a secret of nature’s wisdom: a mixture of elements, \\nresolved into the same elements again, a thing surely which no man ought to be \\nashamed of: in a series of other fatal events and consequences, which a rational \\ncreature is subject unto, not improper or incongruous, nor contrary to the natural \\nand proper constitution of man himself. \\nVI. Such and such things, from such and such causes, must of necessity proceed. \\nHe that would not have such things to happen, is as he that would have the fig-tree \\ngrow without any sap or moisture.

And secondly, if any man that is present shall be \\nable to rectify thee or to turn thee from some erroneous persuasion, that thou be al-\\nways ready to change thy mind, and this change to proceed, not from any respect of \\nany pleasure or credit thereon depending, but always from some probable apparent \\nground of justice, or of some public good thereby to be furthered; or from some other \\nsuch inducement. \\nXI. Hast thou reason? I have. Why then makest thou not use of it? For if thy reason \\ndo her part, what more canst thou require? \\nXII. As a part hitherto thou hast had a particular subsistence: and now shalt thou \\nvanish away into the common substance of Him, who first begot thee, or rather thou \\nshalt be resumed again into that original rational substance, out of which all others \\nhave issued, and are propagated. Many small pieces of frankincense are set upon the \\nsame altar, one drops first and is consumed, another after; and it comes all to one. \\nXIII. Within ten days, if so happen, thou shalt be esteemed a god of them, who now if \\nthou shalt return to the dogmata and to the honouring of reason, will esteem of thee \\nno better than of a mere brute, and of an ape. \\nXIV. Not as though thou hadst thousands of years to live. Death hangs over thee: \\nwhilst yet thou livest, whilst thou mayest, be good. \\nXV. Now much time and leisure doth he gain, who is not curious to know what his \\nneighbour hath said, or hath done, or hath attempted, but only what he doth him-\\nself, that it may be just and holy? or to express it in Agathos’13 words, “Not to look \\nabout upon the evil conditions of others, but to run on straight in the line, without \\nany loose and extravagant agitation.” \\nXVI. He who is greedy of credit and reputation after his death, doth not consider, \\nthat they themselves by whom he is remembered, shall soon after every one of them \\nbe dead; and they likewise that succeed those; until at last all memory, which hither-\\nto by the succession of men admiring and soon after dying hath had its course, be \\n                                            13 [“Agathos” (18): This is probably not a proper name, but the text seems to be unsound.

But suppose that both they that shall remember thee, and thy memory \\nwith them should be immortal, what is that to thee? I will not say to thee after thou \\nart dead; but even to thee living, what is thy praise? But only for a secret and politic \\nconsideration, which we call οικονομοίαν,14 or dispensation. For as for that, that it is \\nthe gift of nature, whatsoever is commended in thee, what might be objected from \\nthence, let that now that we are upon another consideration be omitted as unsea-\\nsonable. That which is fair and goodly, whatsoever it be, and in what respect soever \\nit be, that it is fair and goodly, it is so of itself, and terminates in itself, not admitting \\npraise as a part or member: that therefore which is praised, is not thereby made ei-\\nther better or worse. This I understand even of those things, that are commonly \\ncalled fair and good, as those which are commended either for the matter itself, or for \\ncurious workmanship. As for that which is truly good, what can it stand in need of \\nmore than either justice or truth; or more than either kindness and modesty? Which \\nof all those, either becomes good or fair, because commended; or dispraised suffers \\nany damage? Doth the emerald become worse in itself, or more vile if it be not com-\\nmended? Doth gold, or ivory, or purple? Is there anything that doth though never so \\ncommon, as a knife, a flower, or a tree? \\nXVII. If so be that the souls remain after death (say they that will not believe it); how \\nis the air from all eternity able to contain them? How is the earth (say I) ever from \\nthat time able to Contain the bodies of them that are buried? For as here the change \\nand resolution of dead bodies into another kind of subsistence (whatsoever it be); \\nmakes place for other dead bodies: so the souls after death transferred into the air, \\nafter they have conversed there a while, are either by way of transmutation, or trans-\\nfusion, or conflagration, received again into that original rational substance, from \\nwhich all others do proceed: and so give way to those souls, who before coupled and \\nassociated unto bodies, now begin to subsist single. This, upon a supposition that \\nthe souls after death do for a while subsist single, may be answered. And here, (be-\\nsides the number of bodies, so buried and contained by the earth), we may further \\nconsider the number of several beasts, eaten by us men, and by other creatures. For \\nnotwithstanding that such a multitude of them is daily consumed, and as it were \\nburied in the bodies of the eaters, yet is the same place and body able to contain \\nthem, by reason of their conversion, partly into blood, partly into air and fire. What \\nin these things is the speculation of truth? to divide things into that which is passive \\nand material; and that which is active and formal. \\nXVIII. Not to wander out of the way, but upon every motion and desire, to perform \\nthat which is just: and ever to be careful to attain to the true natural apprehension \\nof every fancy, that presents itself. \\nXIX.

Certainly there is nothing better, than for a man to confine himself to necessary \\nactions; to such and so many only, as reason in a creature that knows itself born for \\nsociety, will command and enjoin. This will not only procure that cheerfulness, which \\nfrom the goodness, but that also, which from the paucity of actions doth usually pro-\\nceed. For since it is so, that most of those things, which we either speak or do, are \\nunnecessary; if a man shall cut them off, it must needs follow that he shall thereby \\ngain much leisure, and save much trouble, and therefore at every action a man must \\nprivately by way of admonition suggest unto himself, What? may not this that now I \\ngo about, be of the number of unnecessary actions? Neither must he use himself to \\ncut off actions only, but thoughts and imaginations also, that are unnecessary for so \\nwill unnecessary consequent actions the better be prevented and cut off. \\nXXI. Try also how a good man’s life; (of one, who is well pleased with those things \\nwhatsoever, which among the common changes and chances of this world fall to his \\nown lot and share; and can live well contented and fully satisfied in the justice of his \\nown proper present action, and in the goodness of his disposition for the future): will \\nagree with thee. Thou hast had experience of that other kind of life: make now trial of \\nthis also. Trouble not thyself any more henceforth, reduce thyself unto perfect sim-\\nplicity. Doth any man offend? It is against himself that he doth offend: why should it \\ntrouble thee? Hath anything happened unto thee? It is well, whatsoever it be, it is \\nthat which of all the common chances of the world from the very beginning in the se-\\nries of all other things that have, or shall happen, was destinated and appointed un-\\nto thee. To comprehend all in a few words, our life is short; we must endeavour to \\ngain the present time with best discretion and justice. Use recreation with sobriety. \\nXXII. Either this world is a κόσμος or a comely piece, because all disposed and gov-\\nerned by certain order: or if it be a mixture, though confused, yet still it is a comely \\npiece. For is it possible that in thee there should be any beauty at all, and that in the \\nwhole world there should be nothing but disorder and confusion? and all things in it \\ntoo, by natural different properties one from another differenced and distinguished; \\nand yet all through diffused, and by natural sympathy, one to another united, as \\nthey are? \\nXXIII. A black or malign disposition, an effeminate disposition; an hard inexorable \\ndisposition, a wild inhuman disposition, a sheepish disposition, a childish disposi-\\ntion; a blockish, a false, a scurril, a fraudulent, a tyrannical: what then? If he be a \\nstranger in the world, that knows not the things that are in it; why not he a stranger \\nas well, that wonders at the things that are done in it? \\nXXIV. He is a true fugitive, that flies from reason, by which men are sociable. He \\nblind, who cannot see with the eyes of his understanding. He poor, that stands in \\nneed of another, and hath not in himself all things needful for this life. He an apo-\\nsteme of the world, who by being discontented with those things that happen unto \\nhim in the world, doth as it were apostatise, and separate himself from common na-\\nture’s rational administration. For the same nature it is that brings this unto thee, \\nwhatsoever it be, that first brought thee into the world.

There is, who without so much as a coat; and there is, who without so much as \\na book, doth put philosophy in practice. I am half naked, neither have I bread to eat, \\nand yet I depart not from reason, saith one. But I say; I want the food of good teach-\\ning, and instructions, and yet I depart not from reason. \\nXXVI. What art and profession soever thou hast learned, endeavour to affect it, and \\ncomfort thyself in it; and pass the remainder of thy life as one who from his whole \\nheart commits himself and whatsoever belongs unto him, unto the gods: and as for \\nmen, carry not thyself either tyrannically or servilely towards any. \\nXXVII. Consider in my mind, for example’s sake, the times of Vespasian: thou shalt \\nsee but the same things: some marrying, some bringing up children, some sick, some \\ndying, some fighting, some feasting, some merchandising, some tilling, some flatter-\\ning, some boasting, some suspecting, some undermining, some wishing to die, some \\nfretting and murmuring at their present estate, some wooing, some hoarding, some \\nseeking after magistracies, and some after kingdoms. And is not that their age quite \\nover, and ended? Again, consider now the times of Trajan. There likewise thou seest \\nthe very self-same things, and that age also is now over and ended. In the like man-\\nner consider other periods, both of times and of whole nations, and see how many \\nmen, after they had with all their might and main intended and prosecuted some one \\nworldly thing or other did soon after drop away, and were resolved into the elements. \\nBut especially thou must call to mind them, whom thou thyself in thy lifetime hast \\nknown much distracted about vain things, and in the meantime neglecting to do \\nthat, and closely and unseparably (as fully satisfied with it) to adhere unto it, which \\ntheir own proper constitution did require. And here thou must remember, that thy \\ncarriage in every business must be according to the worth and due proportion of it, \\nfor so shalt thou not easily be tired out and vexed, if thou shalt not dwell upon small \\nmatters longer than is fitting. \\nXXVIII. Those words which once were common and ordinary, are now become ob-\\nscure and obsolete; and so the names of men once commonly known and famous, \\nare now become in a manner obscure and obsolete names. Camillus, Cieso, Volesius, \\nLeonnatus; not long after, Scipio, Cato, then Augustus, then Adrianus, then Antoni-\\nnus Pius: all these in a short time will be out of date, and, as things of another world \\nas it were, become fabulous. And this I say of them, who once shined as the wonders \\nof their ages, for as for the rest, no sooner are they expired, than with them all their \\nfame and memory. And what is it then that shall always be remembered? all is vani-\\nty. What is it that we must bestow our care and diligence upon? even upon this only: \\nthat our minds and wills be just; that our actions be charitable; that our speech be \\nnever deceitful, or that our understanding be not subject to error; that our inclina-\\ntion be always set to embrace whatsoever shall happen unto us, as necessary, as \\nusual, as ordinary, as flowing from such a beginning, and such a fountain, from \\nwhich both thou thyself and all things are. Willingly therefore, and wholly surrender \\nup thyself unto that fatal concatenation, yielding up thyself unto the fates, to be dis-\\nposed of at their pleasure. \\nXXIX.

For if \\nthou think that that only is seed, which either the earth or the womb receiveth, thou \\nart very simple. \\nXXX. Thou art now ready to die, and yet hast thou not attained to that perfect sim-\\nplicity: thou art yet subject to many troubles and perturbations; not yet free from all \\nfear and suspicion of external accidents; nor yet either so meekly disposed towards \\nall men, as thou shouldest; or so affected as one, whose only study and only wisdom \\nis, to be just in all his actions. \\nXXXI.

In another man’s mind and understanding thy evil Cannot subsist, nor in any \\nproper temper or distemper of the natural constitution of thy body, which is but as it \\nwere the coat or cottage of thy soul. Wherein then, but in that part of thee, wherein \\nthe conceit, and apprehension of any misery can subsist? Let not that part therefore \\nadmit any such conceit, and then all is well. Though thy body which is so near it \\nshould either be cut or burnt, or suffer any corruption or putrefaction, yet let that \\npart to which it belongs to judge of these, be still at rest; that is, let her judge this, \\nthat whatsoever it is, that equally may happen to a wicked man, and to a good man, \\nis neither good nor evil. For that which happens equally to him that lives according \\nto nature, and to him that doth not, is neither according to nature, nor against it; \\nand by consequent, neither good nor bad. \\nXXXIII. Ever consider and think upon the world as being but one living substance, \\nand having but one soul, and how all things in the world, are terminated into one \\nsensitive power; and are done by one general motion as it were, and deliberation of \\nthat one soul; and how all things that are, concur in the cause of one another’s be-\\ning, and by what manner of connection and concatenation all things happen. \\nXXXIV. What art thou, that better and divine part excepted, but as Epictetus said \\nwell, a wretched soul, appointed to carry a carcass up and down? \\nXXXV. To suffer change can be no hurt; as no benefit it is, by change to attain to be-\\ning. The age and time of the world is as it were a flood and swift current, consisting \\nof the things that are brought to pass in the world. For as soon as anything hath ap-\\npeared, and is passed away, another succeeds, and that also will presently out of \\nsight. \\nXXXVI. Whatsoever doth happen in the world, is, in the course of nature, as usual \\nand ordinary as a rose in the spring, and fruit in summer. Of the same nature is \\nsickness and death; slander, and lying in wait, and whatsoever else ordinarily doth \\nunto fools use to be occasion either of joy or sorrow. That, whatsoever it is, that \\ncomes after, doth always very naturally, and as it were familiarly, follow upon that \\nwhich was before.

Let that of Heraclitus never be out of thy mind, that the death of earth, is \\nwater, and the death of water, is air; and the death of air, is fire; and so on the con-\\ntrary. Remember him also who was ignorant whither the way did lead, and how that \\nreason being the thing by which all things in the world are administered, and which \\nmen are continually and most inwardly conversant with: yet is the thing, which ordi-\\nnarily they are most in opposition with, and how those things which daily happen \\namong them, cease not daily to be strange unto them, and that we should not either \\nspeak, or do anything as men in their sleep, by opinion and bare imagination: for \\nthen we think we speak and do, and that we must not be as children, who follow \\ntheir father’s example; for best reason alleging their bare καθότι παρειλήψαμεν; or, as \\nby successive tradition from our forefathers we have received it. \\nXXXVIII. Even as if any of the gods should tell thee, Thou shalt certainly die to-\\nmorrow, or next day, thou wouldst not, except thou wert extremely base and pusil-\\nlanimous, take it for a great benefit, rather to die the next day after, than to-morrow; \\n(for alas, what is the difference!) so, for the same reason, think it no great matter to \\ndie rather many years after, than the very next day. \\nXXXIX. Let it be thy perpetual meditation, how many physicians who once looked so \\ngrim, and so tetrically shrunk their brows upon their patients, are dead and gone \\nthemselves. How many astrologers, after that in great ostentation they had foretold \\nthe death of some others, how many philosophers after so many elaborate tracts and \\nvolumes concerning either mortality or immortality; how many brave captains and \\ncommanders, after the death and slaughter of so many; how many kings and ty-\\nrants, after they had with such horror and insolency abused their power upon men’s \\nlives, as though themselves had been immortal; how many, that I may so speak, \\nwhole cities both men and towns: Helice, Pompeii, Herculaneum, and others innu-\\nmerable are dead and gone. Run them over also, whom thou thyself, one after anoth-\\ner, hast known in thy time to drop away. Such and such a one took care of such and \\nsuch a one’s burial, and soon after was buried himself. So one, so another: and all \\nthings in a short time. For herein lieth all15 indeed, ever to look upon all worldly \\nthings, as things for their continuance, that are but for a day: and for their worth, \\nmost vile, and contemptible, as for example, What is man? That which but the other \\nday when he was conceived was vile snivel; and within few days shall be either an \\nembalmed carcass, or mere ashes. Thus must thou according to truth and nature, \\nthroughly consider how man’s life is but for a very moment of time, and so depart \\nmeek and contented: even as if a ripe olive falling should praise the ground that bare \\nher, and give thanks to the tree that begat her. \\nXL.

Oh, wretched I, to whom this mischance is happened! nay, happy I, to whom \\nthis thing being happened, I can continue without grief; neither wounded by that \\nwhich is present, nor in fear of that which is to come. For as for this, it might have \\nhappened unto any man, but any man having such a thing befallen him, could not \\nhave continued without grief. Why then should that rather be an unhappiness, than \\nthis a happiness? But however, canst thou, O man! term that unhappiness, which is \\nno mischance to the nature of man I Canst thou think that a mischance to the na-\\nture of man, which is not contrary to the end and will of his nature? What then hast \\nthou learned is the will of man’s nature?

It is but an ordinary coarse one, yet it is a good effectual remedy against the \\nfear of death, for a man to consider in his mind the examples of such, who greedily \\nand covetously (as it were) did for a long time enjoy their lives. What have they got \\nmore, than they whose deaths have been untimely? Are not they themselves dead at \\nthe last? as Cadiciant’s, Fabius, Julianus Lepidus, or any other who in their lifetime \\nhaving buried many, were at the last buried themselves. The whole space of any \\nman’s life, is but little; and as little as it is, with what troubles, with what manner of \\ndispositions, and in the society of how wretched a body must it be passed! Let it be \\ntherefore unto thee altogether as a matter of indifferency. For if thou shalt look \\nbackward; behold, what an infinite chaos of time doth present itself unto thee; and \\nas infinite a chaos, if thou shalt look forward. In that which is so infinite, what dif-\\nference can there be between that which liveth but three days, and that which liveth \\nthree ages? \\nXLIII. Let thy course ever be the most compendious way. The most compendious, is \\nthat which is according to nature: that is, in all both words and deeds, ever to follow \\nthat which is most sound and perfect.

Am I then yet un-\\nwilling to go about that, for which I myself was born and brought forth into this \\nworld? Or was I made for this, to lay me down, and make much of myself in a warm \\nbed? “O but this is pleasing.” And was it then for this that thou wert born, that thou \\nmightest enjoy pleasure? Was it not in very truth for this, that thou mightest always \\nbe busy and in action? Seest thou not how all things in the world besides, how every \\ntree and plant, how sparrows and ants, spiders and bees: how all in their kind are \\nintent as it were orderly to perform whatsoever (towards the preservation of this or-\\nderly universe) naturally doth become and belong unto thin? And wilt not thou do \\nthat, which belongs unto a man to do? Wilt not thou run to do that, which thy na-\\nture doth require? “But thou must have some rest.” Yes, thou must.

But thou \\nguest beyond thy stint, and beyond that which would suffice, and in matter of action, \\nthere thou comest short of that which thou mayest.

How easy a thing is it for a man to put off from him all turbulent adventitious im-\\naginations, and presently to be in perfect rest and tranquillity! \\nIII. Think thyself fit and worthy to speak, or to do anything that is according to na-\\nture, and let not the reproach, or report of some that may ensue upon it, ever deter \\nthee. If it be right and honest to be spoken or done, undervalue not thyself so much, \\nas to be discouraged from it. As for them, they have their own rational over-ruling \\npart, and their own proper inclination: which thou must not stand and look about to \\ntake notice of, but go on straight, whither both thine own particular, and the com-\\nmon nature do lead thee; and the way of both these, is but one. \\nIV. I continue my course by actions according to nature, until I fall and cease, \\nbreathing out my last breath into that air, by which continually breathed in I did live; \\nand falling upon that earth, out of whose gifts and fruits my father gathered his seed, \\nmy mother her blood, and my nurse her milk, out of which for so many years I have \\nbeen provided, both of meat and drink. And lastly, which beareth me that tread upon \\nit, and beareth with me that so many ways do abuse it, or so freely make use of it, so \\nmany ways to so many ends. \\nV.

Or wilt thou say. that it is through defect of thy natural consti-\\ntution, that thou art constrained to murmur, to be base and wretched to flatter; now \\nto accuse, and now to please, and pacify thy body: to be vainglorious, to be so giddy-\\nheaded., and unsettled in thy thoughts? nay (witnesses be the Gods) of all these thou \\nmightest have been rid long ago: only, this thou must have been contented with, to \\nhave borne the blame of one that is somewhat slow and dull. wherein thou must so \\nexercise thyself, as one who neither doth much take to heart this his natural defect, \\nnor yet pleaseth himself in it. \\nVI. Such there be, who when they have done a good turn to any, are ready to set \\nthem on the score for it, and to require retaliation. Others there be, who though they \\nstand not upon retaliation, to require any, yet they think with themselves neverthe-\\nless, that such a one is their debtor, and they know as their word is what they have \\ndone. Others again there be, who when they have done any such thing, do not so \\nmuch as know what they have done; but are like unto the vine, which beareth her \\ngrapes, and when once she hath borne her own proper fruit, is contented and seeks \\nfor no further recompense. As a horse after a race, and a hunting dog when he hath \\nhunted, and a bee when she hath made her honey, look not for applause and com-\\nmendation; so neither doth that man that rightly doth understand his own nature \\nwhen he hath done a good turn: but from one doth proceed to do another, even as \\nthe vine after she hath once borne fruit in her own proper season, is ready for anoth-\\ner time. Thou therefore must be one of them, who what they do, barely do it without \\nany further thought, and are in a manner insensible of what they do. “Nay but,” will \\nsome reply perchance, “this very thing a rational man is bound unto, to understand \\nwhat it is, that he doeth.” For it is the property, say they, of one that is naturally so-\\nciable, to be sensible, that he doth operate sociably: nay, and to desire, that the par-\\nty him self that is sociably dealt with, should be sensible of it too. I answer, That \\nwhich thou sayest is true indeed, but the true meaning of that which is said, thou \\ndost not understand. And therefore art thou one of those first, whom I mentioned. \\nFor they also are led by a probable appearance of reason. But if thou dost desire to \\nunderstand truly what it is that is said, fear not that thou shalt therefore give over \\nany sociable action. \\nVII.

For neither doth any or-\\ndinary particular nature bring anything to pass, that is not to whatsoever is within \\nthe sphere of its own proper administration and government agreeable and subordi-\\nnate. For these two considerations then thou must be well pleased with anything \\nthat doth happen unto thee. First, because that for thee properly it was brought to \\npass, and unto thee it was prescribed; and that from the very beginning by the series \\nand connection of the first causes, it hath ever had a reference unto thee. And sec-\\nondly, because the good success and perfect welfare, and indeed the very continu-\\nance of Him, that is the Administrator of the whole, doth in a manner depend on it. \\nFor the whole (because whole, therefore entire and perfect) is maimed, and mutilated, \\nif thou shalt cut off anything at all, whereby the coherence, and contiguity as of \\nparts, so of causes, is maintained and preserved.

And remember that philosophy re-\\nquireth nothing of thee, but what thy nature requireth, and wouldest thou thyself \\ndesire anything that is not according to nature? for which of these sayest thou; that \\nwhich is according to nature or against it, is of itself more kind and pleasing? Is it \\nnot for that respect especially, that pleasure itself is to so many men’s hurt and over-\\nthrow, most prevalent, because esteemed commonly most kind, and natural? But \\nconsider well whether magnanimity rather, and true liberty, and true simplicity, and \\nequanimity, and holiness; whether these be not most kind and natural? And pruden-\\ncy itself, what more kind and amiable than it, when thou shalt truly consider with \\nthyself, what it is through all the proper objects of thy rational intellectual faculty \\ncurrently to go on without any fall or stumble? As for the things of the world, their \\ntrue nature is in a manner so involved with obscurity, that unto many philosophers, \\nand those no mean ones, they seemed altogether incomprehensible. and the Stoics \\nthemselves, though they judge them not altogether incomprehensible, yet scarce and \\nnot without much difficulty, comprehensible, so that all assent of ours is fallible, for \\nwho is he that is infallible in his conclusions? From the nature of things, pass now \\nunto their subjects and matter: how temporary, how vile are they I such as may be in \\nthe power and possession of some abominable loose liver, of some common strumpet, \\nof some notorious oppressor and extortioner.

Thou must comfort thyself in the expectation of thy natural dissolution, and in the \\nmeantime not grieve at the delay; but rest contented in those two things. First, that \\nnothing shall happen unto thee, which is not according to the nature of the universe. \\nSecondly, that it is in thy power, to do nothing against thine own proper God, and \\ninward spirit. For it is not in any man’s power to constrain thee to transgress against \\nhim. \\nXI. What is the use that now at this present I make of my soul? Thus from time to \\ntime and upon all occasions thou must put this question to thyself; what is now that \\npart of mine which they call the rational mistress part, employed about? Whose soul \\ndo I now properly possess? a child’s? or a youth’s? a woman’s? or a tyrant’s? some \\nbrute, or some wild beast’s soul? \\nXII. What those things are in themselves, which by the greatest part are esteemed \\ngood, thou mayest gather even from this. For if a man shall hear things mentioned as \\ngood, which are really good indeed, such as are prudence, temperance, justice, forti-\\ntude, after so much heard and conceived, he cannot endure to hear of any more, for \\nthe word good is properly spoken of them. But as for those which by the vulgar are \\nesteemed good, if he shall hear them mentioned as good, he doth hearken for more. \\nHe is well contented to hear, that what is spoken by the comedian, is but familiarly \\nand popularly spoken, so that even the vulgar apprehend the difference.

Proceed therefore, and inquire further, \\nwhether it may not be that those things also which being mentioned upon the stage \\nwere merrily, and with great applause of the multitude, scoffed at with this jest, that \\nthey that possessed them had not in all the world of their own, (such was their afflu-\\nence and plenty) so much as a place where to avoid their excrements. Whether, I say, \\nthose ought not also in very deed to be much respected, and esteemed of, as the only \\nthings that are truly good. \\nXIII. All that I consist of, is either form or matter. No corruption can reduce either of \\nthese unto nothing: for neither did I of nothing become a subsistent creature. Every \\npart of mine then. will by mutation be disposed into a certain part of the whole \\nworld, and that in time into another part; and so in infinitum; by which kind of muta-\\ntion, I also became what I am, and so did they that begot me, and they before them, \\nand so upwards in infinitum. For so we may be allowed to speak, though the age and \\ngovernment of the world, be to some certain periods of time limited, and confined. \\nXIV. Reason, and rational power, are faculties which content themselves with them-\\nselves, and their own proper operations. And as for their first inclination and motion, \\nthat they take from themselves. But their progress is right to the end and object, \\nwhich is in their way, as it were, and lieth just before them: that is, which is feasible \\nand possible, whether it be that which at the first they proposed to themselves, or \\nno. For which reason also such actions are termed κατορθώσεις,16 to intimate the di-\\nrectness of the way, by which they are achieved. Nothing must be thought to belong \\nto a man, which doth not belong unto him as he is a man. These, the event of pur-\\nposes, are not things required in a man. The nature of man doth not profess any \\nsuch things. The final ends and consummations of actions are nothing at all to a \\nman’s nature. The end therefore of a man, or the summum bonum whereby that end \\nis fulfilled, cannot consist in the consummation of actions purposed and intended. \\nAgain, concerning these outward worldly things, were it so that any of them did \\nproperly belong unto man, then would it not belong unto man, to condemn them and \\nto stand in opposition with them. Neither would he be praiseworthy that can live \\nwithout them; or he good, (if these were good indeed) who of his own accord doth de-\\nprive himself of any of them. But we see contrariwise, that the more a man doth \\nwithdraw himself from these wherein external pomp and greatness doth consist, or \\nany other like these; or the better he doth bear with the loss of these, the better he is \\naccounted. \\nXV. Such as thy thoughts and ordinary cogitations are, such will thy mind be in \\ntime. For the soul doth as it were receive its tincture from the fancies, and imagina-\\ntions. Dye it therefore and thoroughly soak it with the assiduity of these cogitations. \\nAs for example. Wheresoever thou mayest live, there it is in thy power to live well and \\nhappy. But thou mayest live at the Court, there then also mayest thou live well and \\nhappy. Again, that which everything is made for, he is also made unto that, and \\ncannot but naturally incline unto it. That which anything doth naturally incline un-\\n                                            16 [κατορθώσεις (15): Acts of “rightness” or “straightness.”]\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Safari', 'creationdate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'title': 'https:/www.maximusveritas.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations', 'author': 'Arshad Kazi', 'moddate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'source': '/content/meidtations (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 128, 'page': 42, 'page_label': '43'}, page_content=\"MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS \\nFIFTH BOOK \\nMarcus Aurelius' Meditations - tr.

Wherein the end of everything doth consist, therein also doth \\nhis good and benefit consist. Society therefore is the proper good of a rational crea-\\nture. For that we are made for society, it hath long since been demonstrated. Or can \\nany man make any question of this, that whatsoever is naturally worse and inferior, \\nis ordinarily subordinated to that which is better? and that those things that are \\nbest, are made one for another? And those things that have souls, are better than \\nthose that have none? and of those that have, those best that have rational souls? \\nXVI. To desire things impossible is the part of a mad man. But it is a thing impossi-\\nble, that wicked man should not commit some such things. Neither doth anything \\nhappen to any man, which in the ordinary course of nature as natural unto him doth \\nnot happen. Again, the same things happen unto others also. And truly, if either he \\nthat is ignorant that such a thing hath happened unto him, or he that is ambitious \\nto be commended for his magnanimity, can be patient, and is not grieved: is it not a \\ngrievous thing, that either ignorance, or a vain desire to please and to be commend-\\ned, should be more powerful and effectual than true prudence? As for the things \\nthemselves, they touch not the soul, neither can they have any access unto it: nei-\\nther can they of themselves any ways either affect it, or move it. For she herself alone \\ncan affect and move herself, and according as the dogmata and opinions are, which \\nshe doth vouchsafe herself; so are those things which, as accessories, have any co-\\nexistence with her. \\nXVII. After one consideration, man is nearest unto us; as we are bound to do them \\ngood, and to bear with them. But as he may oppose any of our true proper actions, \\nso man is unto me but as a thing indifferent: even as the sun, or the wind, or some \\nwild beast. By some of these it may be, that some operation or other of mine, may be \\nhindered; however, of my mind and resolution itself, there can be no let or impedi-\\nment, by reason of that ordinary constant both exception (or reservation wherewith it \\ninclineth) and ready conversion of objects; from that which may not be, to that which \\nmay be, which in the prosecution of its inclinations, as occasion serves, it doth ob-\\nserve. For by these the mind doth turn and convert any impediment whatsoever, to \\nbe her aim and purpose. So that what before was the impediment, is now the princi-\\npal object of her working; and that which before was in her way, is now her readiest \\nway. \\nXVIII. Honour that which is chiefest and most powerful in the world, and that is it, \\nwhich makes use of all things, and governs all things. So also in thyself; honour that \\nwhich is chiefest, and most powerful; and is of one kind and nature with that which \\nwe now spake of. For it is the very same, which being in thee, turneth all other things \\nto its own use, and by whom also thy life is governed. \\nXIX. That which doth not hurt the city itself; cannot hurt any citizen. This rule thou \\nmust remember to apply and make use of upon every conceit and apprehension of \\nwrong. If the whole city be not hurt by this, neither am I certainly. And if the whole \\nbe not, why should I make it my private grievance? consider rather what it is wherein \\nhe is overseen that is thought to have done the wrong. Again, often meditate how \\nswiftly all things that subsist, and all things that are done in the world, are carried \\naway, and as it were conveyed out of sight: for both the substance themselves, we \\nsee as a flood, are in a continual flux; and all actions in a perpetual change; and the\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Safari', 'creationdate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'title': 'https:/www.maximusveritas.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations', 'author': 'Arshad Kazi', 'moddate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'source': '/content/meidtations (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 128, 'page': 43, 'page_label': '44'}, page_content=\"MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS \\nFIFTH BOOK \\nMarcus Aurelius' Meditations - tr.

Next unto this, and \\nwhich follows upon it, consider both the infiniteness of the time already past, and the \\nimmense vastness of that which is to come, wherein all things are to be resolved and \\nannihilated. Art not thou then a very fool, who for these things, art either puffed up \\nwith pride, or distracted with cares, or canst find in thy heart to make such moans \\nas for a thing that would trouble thee for a very long time? Consider the whole uni-\\nverse whereof thou art but a very little part, and the whole age of the world together, \\nwhereof but a short and very momentary portion is allotted unto thee, and all the \\nfates and destinies together, of which how much is it that comes to thy part and \\nshare! Again: another doth trespass against me. Let him look to that. He is master of \\nhis own disposition, and of his own operation. I for my part am in the meantime in \\npossession of as much, as the common nature would have me to possess: and that \\nwhich mine own nature would have me do, I do. \\nXX. Let not that chief commanding part of thy soul be ever subject to any variation \\nthrough any corporal either pain or pleasure, neither suffer it to be mixed with these, \\nbut let it both circumscribe itself, and confine those affections to their own proper \\nparts and members. But if at any time they do reflect and rebound upon the mind \\nand understanding (as in an united and compacted body it must needs); then must \\nthou not go about to resist sense and feeling, it being natural. However let not thy \\nunderstanding to this natural sense and feeling, which whether unto our flesh pleas-\\nant or painful, is unto us nothing properly, add an opinion of either good or bad and \\nall is well. \\nXXI. To live with the Gods. He liveth with the Gods, who at all times affords unto \\nthem the spectacle of a soul, both contented and well pleased with whatsoever is af-\\nforded, or allotted unto her; and performing whatsoever is pleasing to that Spirit, \\nwhom (being part of himself) Jove hath appointed to every man as his overseer and \\ngovernor. \\nXXII. Be not angry neither with him whose breath, neither with him whose arm \\nholes, are offensive. What can he do? such is his breath naturally, and such are his \\narm holes; and from such, such an effect, and such a smell must of necessity pro-\\nceed. “O, but the man (sayest thou) hath understanding in him, and might of himself \\nknow, that he by standing near, cannot choose but offend.” And thou also (God bless \\nthee!) hast understanding. Let thy reasonable faculty, work upon his reasonable fac-\\nulty; show him his fault, admonish him. If he hearken unto thee, thou hast cured \\nhim, and there will be no more occasion of anger. \\nXXIII. “Where there shall neither roarer be, nor harlot.” Why so? As thou dost pur-\\npose to live, when thou hast retired thyself to some such place, where neither roar-\\ner17 nor harlot is: so mayest thou here. And if they will not suffer thee, then mayest \\nthou leave thy life rather than thy calling, but so as one that doth not think himself \\nanyways wronged. Only as one would say, Here is a smoke; I will out of it. And what \\na great matter is this! Now till some such thing force me out, I will continue free; nei-\\n                                            17 [“Roarer” (28): Gr. “tragedian.” Ed. 1 has “whoremonger,” ed. 2 corrects to “harlot,” but omits to alter the \\nword at its second occurrence.]\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Safari', 'creationdate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'title': 'https:/www.maximusveritas.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations', 'author': 'Arshad Kazi', 'moddate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'source': '/content/meidtations (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 128, 'page': 44, 'page_label': '45'}, page_content=\"MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS \\nFIFTH BOOK \\nMarcus Aurelius' Meditations - tr.

Again, how many truly good things have certainly by thee been discerned? \\nhow many pleasures, how many pains hast thou passed over with contempt? how \\nmany things eternally glorious hast thou despised? towards how many perverse un-\\nreasonable men hast thou carried thyself kindly, and discreetly? \\nXXVI. Why should imprudent unlearned souls trouble that which is both learned, \\nand prudent? And which is that that is so? she that understandeth the beginning \\nand the end, and hath the true knowledge of that rational essence, that passeth \\nthrough all things subsisting, and through all ages being ever the same, disposing \\nand dispensing as it were this universe by certain periods of time. \\nXXVII. Within a very little while, thou wilt be either ashes, or a sceletum; and a name \\nperchance; and perchance, not so much as a name. And what is that but an empty \\nsound, and a rebounding echo? Those things which in this life are dearest unto us, \\nand of most account, they are in themselves but vain, putrid, contemptible. The most \\nweighty and serious, if rightly esteemed, but as puppies, biting one another: or un-\\ntoward children, now laughing and then crying. As for faith, and modesty, and jus-\\ntice, and truth, they long since, as one of the poets19 hath it, have abandoned this \\nspacious earth, and retired themselves unto heaven. What is it then that doth keep \\nthee here, if things sensible be so mutable and unsettled? and the senses so obscure, \\nand so fallible? and our souls nothing but an exhalation of blood? and to be in credit \\namong such, be but vanity? What is it that thou dost stay for? an extinction, or a \\ntranslation; either of them with a propitious and contented mind. But still that time \\ncome, what will content thee? what else, but to worship and praise the Gods; and to \\ndo good unto men. To bear with them, and to forbear to do them any wrong. And for \\nall external things belonging either to this thy wretched body, or life, to remember \\nthat they are neither thine, nor in thy power. \\nXXVIII. Thou mayest always speed, if thou wilt but make choice of the right way; if in \\nthe course both of thine opinions and actions, thou wilt observe a true method. \\n                                            18 [“Thou hast . . . them” (33): A quotation from Homer, Odyssey, iv. 690.] \\n19 [“One of the poets” (33): Hesiod, Op. et Dies, 197.]\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Safari', 'creationdate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'title': 'https:/www.maximusveritas.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations', 'author': 'Arshad Kazi', 'moddate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'source': '/content/meidtations (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 128, 'page': 45, 'page_label': '46'}, page_content=\"MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS \\nFIFTH BOOK \\nMarcus Aurelius' Meditations - tr.

That rational essence that doth govern it, bath in itself no \\ncause to do evil. It bath no evil in itself; neither can it do anything that is evil: \\nneither can anything be hurt by it.

Be it all one unto thee, whether half frozen or well warm; whether only slumber-\\ning, or after a full sleep; whether discommended or commended thou do thy duty: or \\nwhether dying or doing somewhat else; for that also “to die,” must among the rest be \\nreckoned as one of the duties and actions of our lives. \\nIII. Look in, let not either the proper quality, or the true worth of anything pass thee, \\nbefore thou hast fully apprehended it. \\nIV. All substances come soon to their change, and either they shall be resolved by \\nway of exhalation (if so be that all things shall be reunited into one substance), or as \\nothers maintain, they shall be scattered and dispersed. As for that Rational Essence \\nby which all things are governed, as it best understandeth itself, both its own dispo-\\nsition, and what it doth, and what matter it hath to do with and accordingly doth all \\nthings; so we that do not, no wonder, if we wonder at many things, the reasons \\nwhereof we cannot comprehend. \\nV. The best kind of revenge is, not to become like unto them. \\nVI. Let this be thy only joy, and thy only comfort, from one sociable kind action with-\\nout intermission to pass unto another, God being ever in thy mind. \\nVII. The rational commanding part, as it alone can stir up and turn itself; so it \\nmaketh both itself to be, and everything that happeneth, to appear unto itself, as it \\nwill itself. \\nVIII. According to the nature of the universe all things particular are determined, not \\naccording to any other nature, either about compassing and containing; or within, \\ndispersed and contained; or without, depending. Either this universe is a mere con-\\nfused mass, and an intricate context of things, which shall in time be scattered and \\ndispersed again: or it is an union consisting of order, and administered by Provi-\\ndence. If the first, why should I desire to continue any longer in this fortuit confusion \\nand commixtion? or why should I take care for anything else, but that as soon as \\nmay be I may be earth again? And why should I trouble myself any more whilst I \\nseek to please the Gods? Whatsoever I do, dispersion is my end, and will come upon \\nme whether I will or no. But if the latter be, then am not I religious in vain; then will I \\nbe quiet and patient, and put my trust in Him, who is the Governor of all. \\nIX. Whensoever by some present hard occurrences thou art constrained to be in \\nsome sort troubled and vexed, return unto thyself as soon as may be, and be not out \\nof tune longer than thou must needs. For so shalt thou be the better able to keep thy \\npart another time, and to maintain the harmony, if thou dost use thyself to this con-\\ntinually; once out, presently to have recourse unto it, and to begin again. \\nT\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Safari', 'creationdate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'title': 'https:/www.maximusveritas.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations', 'author': 'Arshad Kazi', 'moddate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'source': '/content/meidtations (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 128, 'page': 47, 'page_label': '48'}, page_content=\"MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS \\nSIXTH BOOK \\nMarcus Aurelius' Meditations - tr.

How marvellous useful it is for a man to represent unto himself meats, and all \\nsuch things that are for the mouth, under a right apprehension and imagination! as \\nfor example: This is the carcass of a fish; this of a bird; and this of a hog. And again \\nmore generally; This phalernum, this excellent highly commended wine, is but the \\nbare juice of an ordinary grape. This purple robe, but sheep’s hairs, dyed with the \\nblood of a shellfish. So for coitus, it is but the attrition of an ordinary base entrail, \\nand the excretion of a little vile snivel, with a certain kind of convulsion: according to \\nHippocrates his opinion. How excellent useful are these lively fancies and representa-\\ntions of things, thus penetrating and passing through the objects, to make their true \\nnature known and apparent! This must thou use all thy life long, and upon all occa-\\nsions: and then especially, when matters are apprehended as of great worth and re-\\nspect, thy art and care must be to uncover them, and to behold their vileness, and to \\ntake away from them all those serious circumstances and expressions, under which \\nthey made so grave a show. For outward pomp and appearance is a great juggler; \\nand then especially art thou most in danger to be beguiled by it, when (to a man’s \\nthinking) thou most seemest to be employed about matters of moment. \\nXII. See what Crates pronounceth concerning Xenocrates himself. \\nXIII. Those things which the common sort of people do admire, are most of them \\nsuch things as are very general, and may be comprehended under things merely \\nnatural, or naturally affected and qualified:21 as stones, wood, figs, vines, olives. \\nThose that be admired by them that are more moderate and restrained, are compre-\\nhended under things animated: as flocks and herds. Those that are yet more gentle \\nand curious, their admiration is commonly confined to reasonable creatures only; \\nnot in general as they are reasonable, but as they are capable of art, or of some craft \\nand subtile invention: or perchance barely to reasonable creatures; as they that de-\\nlight in the possession of many slaves. But he that honours a reasonable soul in \\ngeneral, as it is reasonable and naturally sociable, doth little regard anything else: \\nand above all things is careful to preserve his own, in the continual habit and exer-\\ncise both of reason and sociableness: and thereby doth co-operate with him, of \\nwhose nature he doth also participate; God. \\nXIV.

Not vegetative spiration, it is not surely (which plants have) that in this life \\nshould be so dear unto us; nor sensitive respiration, the proper life of beasts, both \\ntame and wild; nor this our imaginative faculty; nor that we are subject to be led and \\ncarried up and down by the strength of our sensual appetites; or that we can gather, \\nand live together; or that we can feed: for that in effect is no better, than that we can \\nvoid the excrements of our food. What is it then that should be dear unto us? to hear \\na clattering noise? if not that, then neither to be applauded by the tongues of men. \\nFor the praises of many tongues, is in effect no better than the clattering of so many \\ntongues. If then neither applause, what is there remaining that should be dear unto \\nthee? This I think: that in all thy motions and actions thou be moved, and restrained \\naccording to thine own true natural constitution and Construction only. And to this \\neven ordinary arts and professions do lead us. For it is that which every art doth aim \\nat, that whatsoever it is, that is by art effected and prepared, may be fit for that work \\nthat it is prepared for. This is the end that he that dresseth the vine, and he that \\ntakes upon him either to tame colts, or to train up dogs, doth aim at. What else doth \\nthe education of children, and all learned professions tend unto? Certainly then it is \\nthat, which should be dear unto us also. If in this particular it go well with thee, care \\nnot for the obtaining of other things. But is it so, that thou canst not but respect \\nother things also? Then canst not thou truly be free? then canst thou not have self-\\ncontent: then wilt thou ever be subject to passions. For it is not possible, but that \\nthou must be envious, and jealous, and suspicious of them whom thou knowest can \\nbereave thee of such things; and again, a secret underminer of them, whom thou \\nseest in present possession of that which is dear unto thee. To be short, he must of \\nnecessity be full of confusion within himself, and often accuse the Gods, whosoever \\nstands in need of these things. But if thou shalt honour and respect thy mind only, \\nthat will make thee acceptable towards thyself, towards thy friends very tractable; \\nand conformable and concordant with the Gods; that is, accepting with praises \\nwhatsoever they shall think good to appoint and allot unto thee. \\nXVI. Under, above, and about, are the motions of the elements; but the motion of vir-\\ntue, is none of those motions, but is somewhat more excellent and divine. Whose way \\n(to speed and prosper in it) must be through a way, that is not easily comprehended. \\nXVII. Who can choose but wonder at them?22 They will not speak well of them that \\nare at the same time with them, and live with them; yet they themselves are very \\nambitious, that they that shall follow, whom they have never seen, nor shall ever see, \\nshould speak well of them.

Suppose that at the palestra somebody hath all to-torn thee with his nails, and \\nhath broken thy head. Well, thou art wounded. Yet thou dost not exclaim; thou art \\nnot offended with him. Thou dost not suspect him for it afterwards, as one that \\nwatcheth to do thee a mischief. Yea even then, though thou dost thy best to save \\nthyself from him, yet not from him as an enemy.

If anybody shall reprove me, and shall make it apparent unto me, that in any \\neither opinion or action of mine I do err, I will most gladly retract. For it is the truth \\nthat I seek after, by which I am sure that never any man was hurt; and as sure, that \\nhe is hurt that continueth in any error, or ignorance whatsoever. \\nXXI. I for my part will do what belongs unto me; as for other things, whether things \\nunsensible or things irrational; or if rational, yet deceived and ignorant of the true \\nway, they shall not trouble or distract me. For as for those creatures which are not \\nendued with reason and all other things and matters of the world whatsoever I freely, \\nand generously, as one endued with reason, of things that have none, make use of \\nthem. And as for men, towards them as naturally partakers of the same reason, my \\ncare is to carry myself sociably. But whatsoever it is that thou art about, remember \\nto call upon the Gods. And as for the time how long thou shalt live to do these \\nthings, let it be altogether indifferent unto thee, for even three such hours are suffi-\\ncient. \\nXXII.

Here then likewise remember, that every duty that \\nbelongs unto a man doth consist of some certain letters or numbers as it were, to \\nwhich without any noise or tumult keeping thyself thou must orderly proceed to thy \\nproposed end, forbearing to quarrel with him that would quarrel and fall out with \\nthee.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Safari', 'creationdate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'title': 'https:/www.maximusveritas.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations', 'author': 'Arshad Kazi', 'moddate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'source': '/content/meidtations (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 128, 'page': 50, 'page_label': '51'}, page_content=\"MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS \\nSIXTH BOOK \\nMarcus Aurelius' Meditations - tr.

Do all things as becometh the disciple of Antoninus Pius. Remember his \\nresolute constancy in things that were done by him according to reason, his equabil-\\nity in all things, his sanctity; the cheerfulness of his countenance, his sweetness, \\nand how free he was from all vainglory; how careful to come to the true and exact \\nknowledge of matters in hand, and how he would by no means give over till he did \\nfully, and plainly understand the whole state of the business; and how patiently, and \\nwithout any contestation he would bear with them, that did unjustly condemn him: \\nhow he would never be over-hasty in anything, nor give ear to slanders and false ac-\\ncusations, but examine and observe with best diligence the several actions and dis-\\npositions of men. Again, how he was no backbiter, nor easily frightened, nor suspi-\\ncious, and in his language free from all affectation and curiosity: and how easily he \\nwould content himself with few things, as lodging, bedding, clothing, and ordinary \\nnourishment, and attendance. How able to endure labour, how patient; able through \\nhis spare diet to continue from morning to evening without any necessity of with-\\ndrawing before his accustomed hours to the necessities of nature: his uniformity and \\nconstancy in matter of friendship. How he would bear with them that with all bold-\\nness and liberty opposed his opinions; and even rejoice if any man could better ad-\\nvise him: and lastly, how religious he was without superstition. All these things of \\nhim remember, that whensoever thy last hour shall come upon thee, it may find \\nthee, as it did him, ready for it in the possession of a good conscience. \\nXXIX. Stir up thy mind, and recall thy wits again from thy natural dreams, and vi-\\nsions, and when thou art perfectly awoken, and canst perceive that they were but \\ndreams that troubled thee, as one newly awakened out of another kind of sleep look \\nupon these worldly things with the same mind as thou didst upon those, that thou \\nsawest in thy sleep.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Safari', 'creationdate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'title': 'https:/www.maximusveritas.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations', 'author': 'Arshad Kazi', 'moddate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'source': '/content/meidtations (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 128, 'page': 51, 'page_label': '52'}, page_content=\"MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS \\nSIXTH BOOK \\nMarcus Aurelius' Meditations - tr.

Unto my body all things are indifferent, for of itself it \\ncannot affect one thing more than another with apprehension of any difference; as \\nfor my mind, all things which are not within the verge of her own operation, are indif-\\nferent unto her, and for her own operations, those altogether depend of her; neither \\ndoes she busy herself about any, but those that are present; for as for future and \\npast operations, those also are now at this present indifferent unto her. \\nXXXI. As long as the foot doth that which belongeth unto it to do, and the hand that \\nwhich belongs unto it, their labour, whatsoever it be, is not unnatural. So a man as \\nlong as he doth that which is proper unto a man, his labour cannot be against na-\\nture; and if it be not against nature, then neither is it hurtful unto him. But if it were \\nso that happiness did consist in pleasure: how came notorious robbers, impure \\nabominable livers, parricides, and tyrants, in so large a measure to have their part of \\npleasures? \\nXXXII. Dost thou not see, how even those that profess mechanic arts, though in \\nsome respect they be no better than mere idiots, yet they stick close to the course of \\ntheir trade, neither can they find in their heart to decline from it: and is it not a \\ngrievous thing that an architect, or a physician shall respect the course and myster-\\nies of their profession, more than a man the proper course and condition of his own \\nnature, reason, which is common to him and to the Gods? \\nXXXIII. Asia, Europe; what are they, but as corners of the whole world; of which the \\nwhole sea, is but as one drop; and the great Mount Athos, but as a clod, as all pre-\\nsent time is but as one point of eternity. All, petty things; all things that are soon al-\\ntered, soon perished. And all things come from one beginning; either all severally and \\nparticularly deliberated and resolved upon, by the general ruler and governor of all; \\nor all by necessary consequence. So that the dreadful hiatus of a gaping lion, and all \\npoison, and all hurtful things, are but (as the thorn and the mire) the necessary con-\\nsequences of goodly fair things. Think not of these therefore, as things contrary to \\nthose which thou dost much honour, and respect; but consider in thy mind. the true \\nfountain of all. \\nXXXIV He that seeth the things that are now, hath Seen all that either was ever, or \\never shall be, for all things are of one kind; and all like one unto another. Meditate \\noften upon the connection of all things in the world; and upon the mutual relation \\nthat they have one unto another. For all things are after a sort folded and involved \\none within another, and by these means all agree well together. For one thing is con-\\nsequent unto another, by local motion, by natural conspiration and agreement, and \\nby substantial union, or, reduction of all substances into one. \\nXXXV.

An instrument, a tool, an utensil, whatsoever it \\nbe, if it be fit for the purpose it was made for, it is as it should be though he per-\\nchance that made and fitted it, be out of sight and gone. But in things natural, that \\npower which hath framed and fitted them, is and abideth within them still: for which \\nreason she ought also the more to be respected, and we are the more obliged (if we \\nmay live and pass our time according to her purpose and intention) to think that all\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Safari', 'creationdate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'title': 'https:/www.maximusveritas.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations', 'author': 'Arshad Kazi', 'moddate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'source': '/content/meidtations (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 128, 'page': 52, 'page_label': '53'}, page_content=\"MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS \\nSIXTH BOOK \\nMarcus Aurelius' Meditations - tr.

After this manner also, and in this \\nrespect it is, that he that is all in all doth enjoy his happiness. \\nXXXVI. What things soever are not within the proper power and jurisdiction of thine \\nown will either to compass or avoid, if thou shalt propose unto thyself any of those \\nthings as either good, or evil; it must needs be that according as thou shalt either fall \\ninto that which thou dost think evil, or miss of that which thou dost think good, so \\nwilt thou be ready both to complain of the Gods, and to hate those men, who either \\nshall be so indeed, or shall by thee be suspected as the cause either of thy missing of \\nthe one, or falling into the other. And indeed we must needs commit many evils, if we \\nincline to any of these things, more or less, with an opinion of any difference. But if \\nwe mind and fancy those things only, as good and bad, which wholly depend of our \\nown wills, there is no more occasion why we should either murmur against the Gods, \\nor be at enmity with any man. \\nXXXVII. We all work to one effect, some willingly, and with a rational apprehension of \\nwhat we do: others without any such knowledge. As I think Heraclitus in a place \\nspeaketh of them that sleep, that even they do work in their kind, and do confer to \\nthe general operations of the world. One man therefore doth co-operate after one \\nsort, and another after another sort; but even he that doth murmur, and to his pow-\\ner doth resist and hinder; even he as much as any doth co-operate. For of such also \\ndid the world stand in need. Now do thou consider among which of these thou wilt \\nrank thyself. For as for him who is the Administrator of all, he will make good use of \\nthee whether thou wilt or no, and make thee (as a part and member of the whole) so \\nto co-operate with him, that whatsoever thou doest, shall turn to the furtherance of \\nhis own counsels, and resolutions. But be not thou for shame such a part of the \\nwhole, as that vile and ridiculous verse (which Chrysippus in a place doth mention)23 \\nis a part of the comedy. \\nXXXVIII. Doth either the sun take upon him to do that which belongs to the rain? or \\nhis son Aesculapius that, which unto the earth doth properly belong? How is it with \\nevery one of the stars in particular? Though they all differ one from another, and \\nhave their several charges and functions by themselves, do they not all nevertheless \\nconcur and co-operate to one end? \\nXXXIX. If so be that the Gods have deliberated in particular of those things that \\nshould happen unto me, I must stand to their deliberation, as discrete and wise. For \\nthat a God should be an imprudent God, is a thing hard even to conceive: and why \\nshould they resolve to do me hurt? for what profit either unto them or the universe \\n(which they specially take care for) could arise from it? But if so be that they have \\nnot deliberated of me in particular, certainly they have of the whole in general, and \\nthose things which in consequence and coherence of this general deliberation hap-\\npen unto me in particular, I am bound to embrace and accept of.

Now that unto every one is \\nmost profitable, which is according to his own constitution and nature. And my na-\\nture is, to be rational in all my actions and as a good, and natural member of a city \\nand commonwealth, towards my fellow members ever to be sociably and kindly dis-\\nposed and affected. My city and country as I am Antoninus, is Rome; as a man, the \\nwhole world. Those things therefore that are expedient and profitable to those cities, \\nare the only things that are good and expedient for me. \\nXL. Whatsoever in any kind doth happen to any one, is expedient to the whole. And \\nthus much to content us might suffice, that it is expedient for the whole in general. \\nBut yet this also shalt thou generally perceive, if thou dost diligently take heed, that \\nwhatsoever doth happen to any one man or men. . . . 24 And now I am content that \\nthe word expedient, should more generally be understood of those things which we \\notherwise call middle things, or things indifferent; as health, wealth, and the like. \\nXLI. As the ordinary shows of the theatre and of other such places, when thou art \\npresented with them, affect thee; as the same things still seen, and in the same fash-\\nion, make the sight ingrateful and tedious; so must all the things that we see all our \\nlife long affect us. For all things, above and below, are still the same, and from the \\nsame causes. When then will there be an end? \\nXLII. Let the several deaths of men of all sorts, and of all sorts of professions, and of \\nall sort of nations, be a perpetual object of thy thoughts, . . . 25 so that thou mayst \\neven come down to Philistio, Phoebus, and Origanion. Pass now to other generations. \\nThither shall we after many changes, where so many brave orators are; where so \\nmany grave philosophers; Heraclitus, Pythagoras, Socrates. Where so many heroes of \\nthe old times; and then so many brave captains of the latter times; and so many \\nkings. After all these, where Eudoxus, Hipparchus, Archimedes; where so many oth-\\ner sharp, generous, industrious, subtile, peremptory dispositions; and among others, \\neven they, that have been the greatest scoffers and deriders of the frailty and brevity \\nof this our human life; as Menippus, and others, as many as there have been such \\nas he. Of all these consider, that they long since are all dead, and gone. And what do \\nthey suffer by it! Nay they that have not so much as a name remaining, what are \\nthey the worse for it? One thing there is, and that only, which is worth our while in \\nthis world, and ought by us much to be esteemed; and that is, according to truth \\nand righteousness, meekly and lovingly to converse with false, and unrighteous men. \\nXLIII. When thou wilt comfort and cheer thyself, call to mind the several gifts and vir-\\ntues of them, whom thou dost daily converse with; as for example, the industry of \\nthe one; the modesty of another; the liberality of a third; of another some other thing. \\nFor nothing can so much rejoice thee, as the resemblances and parallels of several \\n                                            24 [“Man or men . . .” (45).

Just as much reason hast thou to grieve that thou must live but so \\nmany years, and not longer. For as for bulk and substance thou dost content thyself \\nwith that proportion of it that is allotted unto thee, so shouldst thou for time. \\nXLV.

But if any shall \\nby force withstand thee, and hinder thee in it, convert thy virtuous inclination from \\none object unto another, from justice to contented equanimity, and cheerful pa-\\ntience: so that what in the one is thy hindrance, thou mayst make use of it for the \\nexercise of another virtue: and remember that it was with due exception, and reser-\\nvation, that thou didst at first incline and desire.

It is in thy power absolutely to exclude all manner of conceit and opinion, as \\nconcerning this matter; and by the same means, to exclude all grief and sorrow from \\nthy soul. For as for the things and objects themselves, they of themselves have no \\nsuch power, whereby to beget and force upon us any opinion at all. \\nXLVIII. Use thyself when any man speaks unto thee, so to hearken unto him, as that \\nin the interim thou give not way to any other thoughts; that so thou mayst (as far as \\nis possible) seem fixed and fastened to his very soul, whosoever he be that speaks \\nunto thee. \\nXLIX. That which is not good for the bee-hive, cannot be good for the bee. \\nL.

Generally, above \\nand below, thou shalt find but the same things. The very same things whereof an-\\ncient stories, middle age stories, and fresh stories are full whereof towns are full, and \\nhouses full. There is nothing that is new.

It is in my power concerning this thing that \\nis happened, what soever it be, to conceit that which is right and true. If it be, why \\nthen am I troubled?

See the things of the world again, \\nas thou hast already seen them. For what is it else to live again? Public shows and \\nsolemnities with much pomp and vanity, stage plays, flocks and herds; conflicts and \\ncontentions: a bone thrown to a company of hungry curs; a bait for greedy fishes; the \\npainfulness, and continual burden-bearing of wretched ants, the running to and fro \\nof terrified mice: little puppets drawn up and down with wires and nerves: these be \\nthe objects of the world. among all these thou must stand steadfast, meekly affected, \\nand free from all manner of indignation; with this right ratiocination and apprehen-\\nsion; that as the worth is of those things which a man doth affect, so is in very deed \\nevery man’s worth more or less. \\nIV. Word after word, every one by itself, must the things that are spoken be con-\\nceived and understood; and so the things that are done, purpose after purpose, every \\none by itself likewise.

For whatsoever I do either by myself, or \\nwith some other, the only thing that I must intend, is, that it be good and expedient \\nfor the public.

Be not therefore ashamed, whensoever \\nthou must use the help of others. For whatsoever it be that lieth upon thee to effect, \\nthou must propose it unto thyself, as the scaling of walls is unto a soldier.

Let not things future trouble thee. For if necessity so require that they come to \\npass, thou shalt (whensoever that is) be provided for them with the same reason, by \\nwhich whatsoever is now present, is made both tolerable and acceptable unto thee. \\nAll things are linked and knitted together, and the knot is sacred, neither is there \\nanything in the world, that is not kind and natural in regard of any other thing, or, \\nthat hath not some kind of reference and natural correspondence with whatsoever is \\nin the world besides. For all things are ranked together, and by that decency of its \\ndue place and order that each particular doth observe, they all concur together to the \\nmaking of one and the same κόσμος or world: as if you said, a comely piece, or an \\norderly composition. For all things throughout, there is but one and the same order; \\nand through all things, one and the same God, the same substance and the same \\nlaw. There is one common reason, and one common truth, that belongs unto all rea-\\nsonable creatures, for neither is there save one perfection of all creatures that are of \\nthe same kind, and partakers of the same reason. \\nVII. Whatsoever is material, doth soon vanish away into the common substance of \\nthe whole; and whatsoever is formal, or, whatsoever doth animate that which is ma-\\nterial, is soon resumed into the common reason of the whole; and the fame and \\nmemory of anything, is soon swallowed up by the general age and duration of the \\nwhole. \\nVIII. To a reasonable creature, the same action is both according to nature, and ac-\\ncording to reason. \\nIX. Straight of itself, not made straight.26 \\nX. As several members in one body united, so are reasonable creatures in a body di-\\nvided and dispersed, all made and prepared for one common operation. And this \\nthou shalt apprehend the better, if thou shalt use thyself often to say to thyself, I am \\nμέλος, or a member of the mass and body of reasonable substances. But if thou shalt \\nsay I am μέρος, or a part, thou dost not yet love men from thy heart. The joy that \\nthou takest in the exercise of bounty, is not yet grounded upon a due ratiocination \\nand right apprehension of the nature of things. Thou dost exercise it as yet upon this \\nground barely, as a thing convenient and fitting; not, as doing good to thyself, when \\nthou dost good unto others. \\n                                            26 [§ ix.

Those things that suffer let them complain themselves, if they will; as for \\nme, as long as I conceive no such thing, that that which is happened is evil, I have \\nno hurt; and it is in my power not to conceive any such thing. \\nXII. Whatsoever any man either doth or saith, thou must be good; not for any man’s \\nsake, but for thine own nature’s sake; as if either gold, or the emerald, or purple, \\nshould ever be saying to themselves, Whatsoever any man either doth or saith, I \\nmust still be an emerald, and I must keep my colour. \\nXIII. This may ever be my comfort and security: my understanding, that ruleth over \\nall, will not of itself bring trouble and vexation upon itself. This I say; it will not put \\nitself in any fear, it will not lead itself into any concupiscence. If it be in the power of \\nany other to compel it to fear, or to grieve, it is free for him to use his power. But \\nsure if itself do not of itself, through some false opinion or supposition incline itself \\nto any such disposition; there is no fear. For as for the body, why should I make the \\ngrief of my body, to be the grief of my mind? If that itself can either fear or complain, \\nlet it. But as for the soul, which indeed, can only be truly sensible of either fear or \\ngrief; to which only it belongs according to its different imaginations and opinions, to \\nadmit of either of these, or of their contraries; thou mayst look to that thyself, that it \\nsuffer nothing. Induce her not to any such opinion or persuasion. The understanding \\nis of itself sufficient unto itself, and needs not (if itself doth not bring itself to need) \\nany other thing besides itself, and by consequent as it needs nothing, so neither can \\nit be troubled or hindered by anything, if itself doth not trouble and hinder itself. \\nXIV. What is ευδαιμονία,27 or happiness: but αγαθός δαίμων, or, a good dæmon, or \\nspirit? What then dost thou do here, O opinion? By the Gods I adjure thee, that thou \\nget thee gone, as thou earnest: for I need thee not. Thou earnest indeed unto me ac-\\ncording to thy ancient wonted manner. It is that, that all men have ever been subject \\nunto. That thou camest therefore I am not angry with thee, only begone, now that I \\nhave found thee what thou art. \\nXV. Is any man so foolish as to fear change, to which all things that once were not \\nowe their being? And what is it, that is more pleasing and more familiar to the nature \\nof the universe? How couldst thou thyself use thy ordinary hot baths, should not the \\nwood that heateth them first be changed? How couldst thou receive any nourishment \\nfrom those things that thou hast eaten, if they should not be changed? Can anything \\nelse almost (that is useful and profitable) be brought to pass without change? How \\nthen dost not thou perceive, that for thee also, by death, to come to change, is a \\nthing of the very same nature, and as necessary for the nature of the universe? \\nXVI. Through the substance of the universe, as through a torrent pass all particular \\nbodies, being all of the same nature, and all joint workers with the universe itself as \\nin one of our bodies so many members among themselves.

The nature of the universe, of the common substance of all things as it were of \\nso much wax hath now perchance formed a horse; and then, destroying that figure, \\nhath new tempered and fashioned the matter of it into the form and substance of a \\ntree: then that again into the form and substance of a man: and then that again into \\nsome other. Now every one of these doth subsist but for a very little while. As for dis-\\nsolution, if it be no grievous thing to the chest or trunk, to be joined together; why \\nshould it be more grievous to be put asunder? \\nXVIII. An angry countenance is much against nature, and it is oftentimes the proper \\ncountenance of them that are at the point of death. But were it so, that all anger and \\npassion were so thoroughly quenched in thee, that it were altogether impossible to \\nkindle it any more, yet herein must not thou rest satisfied, but further endeavour by \\ngood consequence of true ratiocination, perfectly to conceive and understand, that all \\nanger and passion is against reason. For if thou shalt not be sensible of thine inno-\\ncence; if that also shall be gone from thee, the comfort of a good conscience, that \\nthou doest all things according to reason: what shouldest thou live any longer for? \\nAll things that now thou seest, are but for a moment. That nature, by which all \\nthings in the world are administered, will soon bring change and alteration upon \\nthem, and then of their substances make other things like unto them: and then soon \\nafter others again of the matter and substance of these: that so by these means, the \\nworld may still appear fresh and new. \\nXIX. Whensoever any man doth trespass against other, presently consider with thy-\\nself what it was that he did suppose to be good, what to be evil, when he did tres-\\npass. For this when thou knowest, thou wilt pity him thou wilt have no occasion ei-\\nther to wonder, or to be angry. For either thou thyself dust yet live in that error and \\nignorance, as that thou dust suppose either that very thing that he doth, or some \\nother like worldly thing, to be good; and so thou art bound to pardon him if he have \\ndone that which thou in the like case wouldst have done thyself. Or if so be that thou \\ndost not any more suppose the same things to be good or evil, that he doth; how \\ncanst thou but be gentle unto him that is in an error? \\nXX. Fancy not to thyself things future, as though they were present but of those that \\nare present, take some aside, that thou takest most benefit of, and consider of them \\nparticularly, how wonderfully thou wouldst want them, if they were not present.

Thy \\nunderstanding is not made worse by it. As for those parts that suffer, let them, if \\nthey can, declare their grief themselves. As for praise and commendation, view their \\nmind and understanding, what estate they are in; what kind of things they fly, and \\nwhat things they seek after: and that as in the seaside, whatsoever was before to be \\nseen, is by the continual succession of new heaps of sand cast up one upon another, \\nsoon hid and covered; so in this life, all former things by those which immediately \\nsucceed. \\nXXIII. Out of Plato. “He then whose mind is endowed with true magnanimity, who \\nhath accustomed himself to the contemplation both of all times, and of all things in \\ngeneral; can this mortal life (thinkest thou) seem any great matter unto him? It is not \\npossible, answered he. Then neither will such a one account death a grievous thing? \\nBy no means.” \\nXXIV.

It \\nis a shameful thing that the face should be subject unto the mind, to be put into \\nwhat shape it will, and to be dressed by it as it will; and that the mind should not \\nbestow so much care upon herself, as to fashion herself, and to dress herself as best \\nbecometh her.” \\nXXV.

As long as right and equi-\\nty is of my side, &c. Not to lament with them, not to tremble, &c”29 \\nXXVI. Out of Plato. “My answer, full of justice and equity, should be this: Thy speech \\nis not right, O man! if thou supposest that he that is of any worth at all, should ap-\\nprehend either life or death, as a matter of great hazard and danger; and should not \\nmake this rather his only care, to examine his own actions, whether just or unjust: \\nwhether actions of a good, or of a wicked man, &c. For thus in very truth stands the \\ncase, O ye men of Athens. What place or station soever a man either hath chosen to \\nhimself, judging it best for himself; or is by lawful authority put and settled in, there-\\nin do I think (all appearance of danger notwithstanding) that he should continue, as \\none who feareth neither death, nor anything else, so much as he feareth to commit \\nanything that is vicious and shameful, &c. But, O noble sir,30 consider I pray, \\nwhether true generosity and true happiness, do not consist in somewhat else rather, \\nthan in the preservation either of our, or other men’s lives. For it is not the part of a \\nman that is a man indeed, to desire to live long or to make much of his life whilst he \\nliveth: but rather (he that is such) will in these things wholly refer himself unto the \\nGods, and believing that which every woman can tell him, that no man can escape \\ndeath; the only thing that he takes thought and care for is this, that what time he \\nliveth, he may live as well and as virtuously as he can possibly, &c. To look about, \\nand with the eyes to follow the course of the stars and planets as though thou \\nwouldst run with them; and to mind perpetually the several changes of the elements \\none into another. For such fancies and imaginations, help much to purge away the \\ndross and filth of this our earthly life,” &c. That also is a fine passage of Plato’s, \\nwhere he speaketh of worldly things in these words: “Thou must also as from some \\nhigher place look down, as it were, upon the things of this world, as flocks, armies, \\nhusbandmen’s labours, marriages, divorces, generations, deaths: the tumults of \\ncourts and places of judicatures; desert places; the several nations of barbarians, \\npublic festivals, mournings, fairs, markets.” How all things upon earth are pell-mell; \\nand how miraculously things contrary one to another, concur to the beauty and per-\\nfection of this universe. \\nXXVII. To look back upon things of former ages, as upon the manifold changes and \\nconversions of several monarchies and commonwealths. We may also foresee things \\nfuture, for they shall all be of the same kind; neither is it possible that they should \\nleave the tune, or break the concert that is now begun, as it were, by these things \\nthat are now done and brought to pass in the world. It comes all to one therefore, \\nwhether a man be a spectator of the things of this life but forty years, or whether he \\nsee them ten thousand years together: for what shall he see more? “And as for those \\nparts that came from the earth, they shall return unto the earth again; and those \\n                                            29 [“It will,” etc. (38): Euripides, Bellerophon, frag. 287 (Nauck). \\n“Lives,” etc. (40): Euripides, Hypsipyle, frag. 757 (Nauck). \\n“As long,” etc. (42): Aristophanes, Acharnæ, 66 I. \\n“Plato” (44): Apology, p. 28 B. \\n“For thus” (45): Apology, p. 28 E.] \\n30 [“But, O noble sir,” etc. (46): Plato, Gorgias, 512 D.]\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Safari', 'creationdate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'title': 'https:/www.maximusveritas.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations', 'author': 'Arshad Kazi', 'moddate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'source': '/content/meidtations (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 128, 'page': 62, 'page_label': '63'}, page_content=\"MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS \\nSEVENTH BOOK \\nMarcus Aurelius' Meditations - tr.

Is he \\nmore bountiful? Is he more modest? Doth he bear all adverse chances with more \\nequanimity: or with his neighbour’s offences with more meekness and gentleness \\nthan I? \\nXXIX. Where the matter may be effected agreeably to that reason, which both unto \\nthe Gods and men is common, there can be no just cause of grief or sorrow. For \\nwhere the fruit and benefit of an action well begun and prosecuted according to the \\nproper constitution of man may be reaped and obtained, or is sure and certain, it is \\nagainst reason that any damage should there be suspected. In all places, and at all \\ntimes, it is in thy power religiously to embrace whatsoever by God’s appointment is \\nhappened unto thee, and justly to converse with those men, whom thou hast to do \\nwith, and accurately to examine every fancy that presents itself, that nothing may \\nslip and steal in, before thou hast rightly apprehended the true nature of it. \\nXXX. Look not about upon other men’s minds and understandings; but look right on \\nforwards whither nature, both that of the universe, in those things that happen unto \\nthee; and thine in particular, in those things that are done by thee: doth lead, and \\ndirect thee. Now every one is bound to do that, which is consequent and agreeable to \\nthat end which by his true natural constitution he was ordained unto. As for all oth-\\ner things, they are ordained for the use of reasonable creatures: as in all things we \\nsee that that which is worse and inferior, is made for that which is better. Reasona-\\nble creatures, they are ordained one for another. That therefore which is chief in eve-\\nry man’s constitution, is, that he intend the common good. The second is, that he \\nyield not to any lusts and motions of the flesh. For it is the part and privilege of the \\nreasonable and intellective faculty, that she can so bound herself, as that neither the \\nsensitive, nor the appetitive faculties, may not anyways prevail upon her. For both \\nthese are brutish. And therefore over both she challengeth mastery, and cannot an-\\nyways endure, if in her right temper, to be subject unto either. And this indeed most \\njustly. For by nature she was ordained to command all in the body. The third thing \\nproper to man by his constitution, is, to avoid all rashness and precipitancy; and not \\nto be subject to error. To these things then, let the mind apply herself and go straight \\non, without any distraction about other things, and she hath her end, and by conse-\\nquent her happiness. \\nXXXI. As one who had lived, and were now to die by right, whatsoever is yet remain-\\ning, bestow that wholly as a gracious overplus upon a virtuous life. Love and affect \\nthat only, whatsoever it be that happeneth, and is by the fates appointed unto thee. \\nFor what can be more reasonable? And as anything doth happen unto thee by way of \\n                                            31 [“And as for those parts,” etc. (50): A quotation from Euripides, Chrysippus, frag. 839 (Nauck).] \\n32 [“With meats,” etc. (51): From Euripides, Supplices, 1110.]\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Safari', 'creationdate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'title': 'https:/www.maximusveritas.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations', 'author': 'Arshad Kazi', 'moddate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'source': '/content/meidtations (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 128, 'page': 63, 'page_label': '64'}, page_content=\"MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS \\nSEVENTH BOOK \\nMarcus Aurelius' Meditations - tr.

Well, what \\ndid they? They grieved; they wondered; they complained. And where are they now? \\nAll dead and gone. Wilt thou also be like one of them? Or rather leaving to men of the \\nworld (whose life both in regard of themselves, and them that they converse with, is \\nnothing but mere mutability; or men of as fickle minds, as fickle bodies; ever chang-\\ning and soon changed themselves: let it be thine only care and study, how to make a \\nright use of all such accidents. For there is good use to be made of them, and they \\nwill prove fit matter for thee to work upon, if it shall be both thy care and thy desire, \\nthat whatsoever thou doest, thou thyself mayst like and approve thyself for it. And \\nboth these, see, that thou remember well, according as the diversity of the matter of \\nthe action that thou art about shall require. Look within; within is the fountain of all \\ngood. Such a fountain, where springing waters can never fail, so thou dig still deeper \\nand deeper. \\nXXXII. Thou must use thyself also to keep thy body fixed and steady; free from all \\nloose fluctuant either motion, or posture. And as upon thy face and looks, thy mind \\nhath easily power over them to keep them to that which is grave and decent; so let it \\nchallenge the same power over the whole body also. But so observe all things in this \\nkind, as that it be without any manner of affectation. \\nXXXIII. The art of true living in this world is more like a wrestler’s, than a dancer’s \\npractice. For in this they both33 agree, to teach a man whatsoever falls upon him, \\nthat he may be ready for it, and that nothing may cast him down. \\nXXXIV. Thou must continually ponder and consider with thyself, what manner of \\nmen they be, and for their minds and understandings what is their present estate, \\nwhose good word and testimony thou dost desire. For then neither wilt thou see \\ncause to complain of them that offend against their wills; or find any want of their \\napplause, if once thou dost but penetrate into the true force and ground both of their \\nopinions, and of their desires. “No soul (saith he) is willingly bereft of the truth,” and \\nby consequent, neither of justice, or temperance, or kindness, and mildness; nor of \\nanything that is of the same kind. It is most needful that thou shouldst always re-\\nmember this. For so shalt thou be far more gentle and moderate towards all men. \\nXXXV. What pain soever thou art in, let this presently come to thy mind, that it is \\nnot a thing whereof thou needest to be ashamed, neither is it a thing whereby thy \\nunderstanding, that hath the government of all, can be made worse. For neither in \\nregard of the substance of it, nor in regard of the end of it (which is, to intend the \\ncommon good) can it alter and corrupt it. This also of Epicurus mayst thou in most \\npains find some help of, that it is “neither intolerable, nor eternal”; so thou keep thy-\\nself to the true bounds and limits of reason and give not way to opinion. This also \\nthou must consider, that many things there be, which oftentimes unsensibly trouble \\nand vex thee, as not armed against them with patience, because they go not ordinari-\\nly under the name of pains, which in very deed are of the same nature as pain; as to \\nslumber unquietly, to suffer heat, to want appetite: when therefore any of these \\n                                            33 [§ xxxiii. “They both,” i.e. life and wrestling. \\n“Says he” (63): Plato, quoted by Epictetus, Arr. i. 28, 2 and 22.]\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Safari', 'creationdate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'title': 'https:/www.maximusveritas.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations', 'author': 'Arshad Kazi', 'moddate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'source': '/content/meidtations (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 128, 'page': 64, 'page_label': '65'}, page_content=\"MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS \\nSEVENTH BOOK \\nMarcus Aurelius' Meditations - tr.

Take heed lest at any time thou stand so affected, though towards unnatural \\nevil men, as ordinary men are commonly one towards another. \\nXXXVII. How know we34 whether Socrates were so eminent indeed, and of so ex-\\ntraordinary a disposition? For that he died more gloriously, that he disputed with the \\nSophists more subtilly; that he watched in the frost35 more assiduously; that being \\ncommanded to fetch innocent Salaminius, he refused to do it more generously; all \\nthis will not serve. Nor that he walked in the streets, with much gravity and majesty, \\nas was objected unto him by his adversaries: which nevertheless a man may well \\ndoubt of, whether it were so or no, or, which above all the rest, if so be that it were \\ntrue, a man would well consider of, whether commendable, or discommendable. The \\nthing therefore that we must inquire into, is this; what manner of soul Socrates had: \\nwhether his disposition was such; as that all that he stood upon, and sought after in \\nthis world, was barely this, that he might ever carry himself justly towards men, and \\nholily towards the Gods. Neither vexing himself to no purpose at the wickedness of \\nothers, nor yet ever condescending to any man’s evil fact, or evil intentions, through \\neither fear, or engagement of friendship. Whether of those things that happened unto \\nhim by God’s appointment, he neither did wonder at any when it did happen, or \\nthought it intolerable in the trial of it. And lastly, whether he never did suffer his \\nmind to sympathise with the senses, and affections of the body. For we must not \\nthink that Nature hath so mixed and tempered it with the body, as that she hath not \\npower to circumscribe herself, and by herself to intend her own ends and occasions. \\nXXXVIII. For it is a thing very possible, that a man should be a very divine man, and \\nyet be altogether unknown. This thou must ever be mindful of, as of this also, that a \\nman’s true happiness doth consist in very few things. And that although thou dost \\ndespair, that thou shalt ever be a good either logician, or naturalist, yet thou art nev-\\ner the further off by it from being either liberal, or modest, or charitable, or obedient \\nunto God. \\nXXXIX. Free from all compulsion in all cheerfulness and alacrity thou mayst run out \\nthy time, though men should exclaim against thee never so much, and the wild \\nbeasts should pull in sunder the poor members of thy pampered mass of flesh. For \\nwhat in either of these or the like cases should hinder the mind to retain her own \\nrest and tranquillity, consisting both in the right judgment of those things that hap-\\npen unto her, and in the ready use of all present matters and occasions? So that her \\njudgment may say, to that which is befallen her by way of cross: this thou art in very \\ndeed, and according to thy true nature: notwithstanding that in the judgment of \\nopinion thou dust appear otherwise: and her discretion to the present object; thou \\nart that, which I sought for. For whatsoever it be, that is now present, shall ever be \\nembraced by me as a fit and seasonable object, both for my reasonable faculty, and \\nfor my sociable, or charitable inclination to work upon. And that which is principal in \\n                                            34 [“How know we,” etc. (66): The Greek means: “How know we whether Telauges were not nobler in character \\nthan Sophocles?” The allusion is unknown.] \\n35 [“Frost” The word is written by Casaubon as a proper name, “Pagus.” \\n“The hardihood of Socrates was famous”; see Plato, Symposium, p. 220.]\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Safari', 'creationdate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'title': 'https:/www.maximusveritas.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations', 'author': 'Arshad Kazi', 'moddate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'source': '/content/meidtations (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 128, 'page': 65, 'page_label': '66'}, page_content=\"MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS \\nSEVENTH BOOK \\nMarcus Aurelius' Meditations - tr.

Can the Gods, who are immortal, for the continuance of so many ages bear \\nwithout indignation with such and so many sinners, as have ever been, yea not only \\nso, but also take such care for them, that they want nothing; and dust thou so griev-\\nously take on, as one that could bear with them no longer; thou that art but for a \\nmoment of time? yea thou that art one of those sinners thyself? A very ridiculous \\nthing it is, that any man should dispense with vice and wickedness in himself, which \\nis in his power to restrain; and should go about to suppress it in others, which is al-\\ntogether impossible. \\nXLII. What object soever, our reasonable and sociable faculty doth meet with, that \\naffords nothing either for the satisfaction of reason, or for the practice of charity, she \\nworthily doth think unworthy of herself. \\nXLIII.

No man useth to be weary of that which is beneficial unto him. But every ac-\\ntion according to nature, is beneficial. Be not weary then of doing that which is bene-\\nficial unto thee, whilst it is so unto others. \\nXLIV. The nature of the universe did once certainly before it was created, whatsoever \\nit hath done since, deliberate and so resolve upon the creation of the world. Now \\nsince that time, whatsoever it is, that is and happens in the world, is either but a \\nconsequent of that one and first deliberation: or if so be that this ruling rational part \\nof the world, takes any thought and care of things particular, they are surely his rea-\\nsonable and principal creatures, that are the proper object of his particular care and \\nprovidence.

And to it also is thy calling and profession repugnant. If \\ntherefore thou dost truly understand, what it is that is of moment indeed; as for thy \\nfame and credit, take no thought or care for that: let it suffice thee if all the rest of \\nthy life, be it more or less, thou shalt live as thy nature requireth, or according to the \\ntrue and natural end of thy making. Take pains therefore to know what it is that thy \\nnature requireth, and let nothing else distract thee. Thou hast already had sufficient \\nexperience, that of those many things that hitherto thou hast erred and wandered \\nabout, thou couldst not find happiness in any of them. Not in syllogisms, and logical \\nsubtilties, not in wealth, not in honour and reputation, not in pleasure. In none of all \\nthese. Wherein then is it to be found? In the practice of those things, which the na-\\nture of man, as he is a man, doth require. How then shall he do those things? if his \\ndogmata, or moral tenets and opinions (from which all motions and actions do pro-\\nceed), be right and true. Which be those dogmata? Those that concern that which is \\ngood or evil, as that there is nothing truly good and beneficial unto man, but that \\nwhich makes him just, temperate, courageous, liberal; and that there is nothing tru-\\nly evil and hurtful unto man, but that which causeth the contrary effects. \\nII. Upon every action that thou art about, put this question to thyself; How will this \\nwhen it is done agree with me? Shall I have no occasion to repent of it? Yet a very \\nlittle while and I am dead and gone; and all things are at end. What then do I care for \\nmore than this, that my present action whatsoever it be, may be the proper action of \\none that is reasonable; whose end is, the common good; who in all things is ruled \\nand governed by the same law of right and reason, by which God Himself is. \\nIII. Alexander, Caius, Pompeius; what are these to Diogenes, Heraclitus, and Socra-\\ntes? These penetrated into the true nature of things; into all causes, and all subjects: \\nand upon these did they exercise their power and authority. But as for those, as the \\nextent of their error was, so far did their slavery extend. \\nIV. What they have done, they will still do, although thou shouldst hang thyself. \\nFirst; let it not trouble thee. For all things both good and evil: come to pass according \\nto the nature and general condition of the universe, and within a very little while, all \\nthings will be at an end; no man will be remembered: as now of Africanus (for exam-\\nple) and Augustus it is already come to pass. Then secondly; fix thy mind upon the \\nthing itself; look into it, and remembering thyself, that thou art bound nevertheless \\nto be a good man, and what it is that thy nature requireth of thee as thou art a man, \\nbe not diverted from what thou art about, and speak that which seemeth unto thee \\nmost just: only speak it kindly, modestly, and without hypocrisy. \\nT\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Safari', 'creationdate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'title': 'https:/www.maximusveritas.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations', 'author': 'Arshad Kazi', 'moddate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'source': '/content/meidtations (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 128, 'page': 67, 'page_label': '68'}, page_content=\"MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS \\nEIGHTH BOOK \\nMarcus Aurelius' Meditations - tr.

That which the nature of the universe doth busy herself about, is; that which is \\nhere, to transfer it thither, to change it, and thence again to take it away, and to car-\\nry it to another place. So that thou needest not fear any new thing. For all things are \\nusual and ordinary; and all things are disposed by equality. \\nVI. Every particular nature hath content, when in its own proper course it speeds. A \\nreasonable nature doth then speed, when first in matter of fancies and imaginations, \\nit gives no consent to that which is either false uncertain. Secondly, when in all its \\nmotions and resolutions it takes its level at the common good only, and that it de-\\nsireth nothing, and flieth from nothing, bet what is in its own power to compass or \\navoid. And lastly, when it willingly and gladly embraceth, whatsoever is dealt and \\nappointed unto it by the common nature. For it is part of it; even as the nature of \\nany one leaf, is part of the common nature of all plants and trees. But that the na-\\nture of a leaf, is part of a nature both unreasonable and unsensible, and which in its \\nproper end may be hindered; or, which is servile and slavish: whereas the nature of \\nman is part of a common nature which cannot be hindered, and which is both rea-\\nsonable and just. From whence also it is, that according to the worth of everything, \\nshe doth make such equal distribution of all things, as of duration, substance form, \\noperation, and of events and accidents. But herein consider not whether thou shalt \\nfind this equality in everything absolutely and by itself; but whether in all the partic-\\nulars of some one thing taken together, and compared with all the particulars of \\nsome other thing, and them together likewise. \\nVII. Thou hast no time nor opportunity to read. What then? Hast thou not time and \\nopportunity to exercise thyself, not to wrong thyself; to strive against all carnal \\npleasures and pains, and to get the upper hand of them; to contemn honour and \\nvainglory; and not only, not to be angry with them, whom towards thee thou doest \\nfind unsensible and unthankful; but also to have a care of them still, and of their \\nwelfare? \\nVIII. Forbear henceforth to complain of the trouble of a courtly life, either in public \\nbefore others, or in private by thyself. \\nIX. Repentance is an inward and self-reprehension for the neglect or omission of \\nsomewhat that was profitable. Now whatsoever is good, is also profitable, and it is \\nthe part of an honest virtuous man to set by it, and to make reckoning of it accord-\\ningly. But never did any honest virtuous man repent of the neglect or omission of any \\ncarnal pleasure: no carnal pleasure then is either good or profitable. \\nX. This, what is it in itself, and by itself, according to its proper constitution? What is \\nthe substance of it? What is the matter, or proper use? What is the form or efficient \\ncause? What is it for in this world, and how long will it abide? Thus must thou exam-\\nine all things, that present themselves unto thee. \\nXI. When thou art hard to he stirred up and awaked out of thy sleep, admonish thy-\\nself and call to mind, that, to perform actions tending to the common good is that \\nwhich thine own proper constitution, and that which the nature of man do require. \\nBut to sleep, is common to unreasonable creatures also.

As every fancy and imagination presents itself unto thee, consider (if it be possi-\\nble) the true nature, and the proper qualities of it, and reason with thyself about it. \\nXIII. At thy first encounter with any one, say presently to thyself: This man, what are \\nhis opinions concerning that which is good or evil? as concerning pain, pleasure, and \\nthe causes of both; concerning honour, and dishonour, concerning life and death? \\nthus and thus. Now if it be no wonder that a man should have such and such opin-\\nions, how can it be a wonder that he should do such and such things? I will remem-\\nber then, that he cannot but do as he doth, holding those opinions that he doth. Re-\\nmember, that as it is a shame for any man to wonder that a fig tree should bear figs, \\nso also to wonder that the world should bear anything, whatsoever it is which in the \\nordinary course of nature it may bear. To a physician also and to a pilot it is a shame \\neither for the one to wonder, that such and such a one should have an ague; or for \\nthe other, that the winds should prove Contrary. \\nXIV. Remember, that to change thy mind upon occasion, and to follow him that is \\nable to rectify thee, is equally ingenuous, as to find out at the first, what is right and \\njust, without help. For of thee nothing is required, that is beyond the extent of thine \\nown deliberation and jun. merit, arid of thine own understanding. \\nXV. If it were thine act and in thine own power, why wouldest thou do it? If it were \\nnot, whom dost tin accuse? the atoms, or the Gods? For to do either, the part of a \\nmad man. Thou must therefore blame nobody, but if it be in thy power, redress what \\nis amiss; if it be not, to what end is it to complain? For nothing should be done but \\nto some certain end. \\nXVI. Whatsoever dieth and falleth, however and wheresoever it die and fall, it cannot \\nfall out of the world. here it have its abode and change, here also shall it have its dis-\\nsolution into its proper elements. The same are the world’s elements, and the ele-\\nments of which thou dost consist. And they when they are changed, they murmur \\nnot; why shouldest thou? \\nXVII. Whatsoever is, was made for something: as a horse, a vine. Why wonderest \\nthou? The sun itself will say of itself, I was made for something; and so hath every \\ngod its proper function. What then were then made for? to disport and delight thy-\\nself? See how even common sense and reason cannot brook it. \\nXVIII. Nature hath its end as well in the end and final consummation of anything \\nthat is, as in the beginning and continuation of it. \\nXIX. As one that tosseth up a ball. And what is a. ball the better, if the motion of it \\nbe upwards; or the worse if it be downwards; or if it chance to fall upon the ground? \\nSo for the bubble; if it continue, what it the better? and if it dissolve, what is it the \\nworse And so is it of a candle too. And so must thou reason with thyself, both in \\nmatter of fame, and in matter of death. For as for the body itself, (the subject of \\ndeath) wouldest thou know the vileness of it? Turn it about that thou mayest behold \\nit the worst sides upwards as well, as in its more ordinary pleasant shape; how doth \\nit look, when it is old and withered? when sick and pained? when in the act of lust, \\nand fornication? And as for fame. This life is short. Both he that praiseth, and he \\nthat is praised; he that remembers, and he that is remembered, will soon be dust \\nand ashes.

And yet the whole earth itself, what is it but as one \\npoint, in regard of the whole world? \\nXX. That which must be the subject of thy consideration, is either the matter itself, \\nor the dogma, or the operation, or the true sense and signification. \\nXXI. Most justly have these things happened unto thee: why dost not thou amend? O \\nbut thou hadst rather become good to-morrow, than to be so to-day. \\nXXII. Shall I do it? I will; so the end of my action be to do good unto men. Doth any-\\nthing by way of cross or adversity happen unto me? I accept it, with reference unto \\nthe Gods, and their providence; the fountain of all things, from which whatsoever \\ncomes to pass, doth hang and depend. \\nXXIII. By one action judge of the rest: this bathing which usually takes up so much \\nof our time, what is it? Oil, sweat, filth; or the sordes of the body: an excrementitious \\nviscosity, the excrements of oil and other ointments used about the body, and mixed \\nwith the sordes of the body: all base and loathsome. And such almost is every part of \\nour life; and every worldly object. \\nXXIV. Lucilla buried Verus; then was Lucilla herself buried by others. So Secunda \\nMaximus, then Secunda herself. So Epitynchanus, Diotimus; then Epitynchanus \\nhimself. So Antoninus Pius, Faustina his wife; then Antoninus himself. This is the \\ncourse of the world. First Celer, Adrianus; then Adrianus himself. And those austere \\nones; those that foretold other men’s deaths; those that were so proud and stately, \\nwhere are they now? Those austere ones I mean, such as were Charax, and Demetri-\\nus the Platonic, and Eudaemon, and others like unto those. They were all but for one \\nday; all dead and gone long since. Some of them no sooner dead, than forgotten. \\nOthers soon turned into fables. Of others, even that which was fabulous, is now long \\nsince forgotten. This thereafter thou must remember, that whatsoever thou art com-\\npounded of, shall soon be dispersed, and that thy life and breath, or thy soul, shall \\neither be no more, or shall be translated, and appointed to some certain place and \\nstation. \\nXXV. The true joy of a man, is to do that which properly belongs unto a man. That \\nwhich is most proper unto a man, is, first, to he kindly affected towards them that \\nare of the same kind and nature as he is himself to contemn all sensual motions and \\nappetites, to discern rightly all plausible fancies and imaginations, to contemplate \\nthe nature of the universe; both it, and things that are done in it. In which kind of \\ncontemplation three several relations are to be observed The first, to the apparent \\nsecondary cause. The Second to the first original cause, God, from whom originally \\nproceeds whatsoever doth happen in the world. The third and last, to them that we \\nlive and converse with: what use may be made of it, to their use and benefit. \\nXXVI. If pain be an evil, either it is in regard of the body; (and that cannot be, be-\\ncause the body of itself is altogether insensible): or in regard of the soul But it is in \\nthe power of the soul, to preserve her own peace and tranquillity, and not to suppose \\nthat pain is evil. For all judgment and deliberation; all prosecution, or aversation is \\nfrom within, whither the sense of evil (except it be let in by opinion) cannot penetrate.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Safari', 'creationdate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'title': 'https:/www.maximusveritas.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations', 'author': 'Arshad Kazi', 'moddate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'source': '/content/meidtations (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 128, 'page': 70, 'page_label': '71'}, page_content=\"MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS \\nEIGHTH BOOK \\nMarcus Aurelius' Meditations - tr.

Wipe off all idle fancies, and say unto thyself incessantly; Now if I will, it is in \\nmy power to keep out of this my soul all wickedness, all lust, and concupiscences, all \\ntrouble and confusion. But on the contrary to behold and consider all things accord-\\ning to their true nature, and to carry myself towards everything according to its true \\nworth. Remember then this thy power that nature hath given thee. \\nXXVIII. Whether thou speak in the Senate or whether thou speak to any particular, \\nlet thy speech In always grave and modest. But thou must not openly and vulgarly \\nobserve that sound and exact form of speaking, concerning that which is truly good \\nand truly civil; the vanity of the world, and of worldly men: which otherwise truth \\nand reason doth prescribe. \\nXXIX. Augustus his court; his wife, his daughter, his nephews, his sons-in-law his \\nsister, Agrippa, his kinsmen, his domestics, his friends; Areus, Maecenas, his slayers \\nof beasts for sacrifice and divination: there thou hast the death of a whole court to-\\ngether. Proceed now on to the rest that have been since that of Augustus. Hath death \\ndwelt with them otherwise, though so many and so stately whilst they lived, than it \\ndoth use to deal with any one particular man? Consider now the death of a whole \\nkindred and family, as of that of the Pompeys, as that also that useth to be written \\nupon some monuments, HE WASS THE LAST OF HIS OWN KINDRED. O what care did his \\npredecessors take, that they might leave a successor, yet behold at last one or other \\nmust of necessity be THE LAST. Here again therefore consider the death of a whole \\nkindred. \\nXXX. Contract thy whole life to the measure and proportion of one single action. And \\nif in every particular action thou dost perform what is fitting to the utmost of thy \\npower, let it suffice thee. And who can hinder thee, but that thou mayest perform \\nwhat is fitting? But there may be some outward let and impediment. Not any, that \\ncan hinder thee, but that whatsoever thou dost, thou may do it, justly, temperately, \\nand with the praise of God. Yea, but there may be somewhat, whereby some opera-\\ntion or other of thine may he hindered. And then, with that very thing that doth hin-\\nder, thou mayest he well pleased, and so by this gentle and equanimious conversion \\nof thy mind unto that which may be, instead of that which at first thou didst intend, \\nin the room of that former action there succeedeth another, which agrees as well \\nwith this contraction of thy life, that we now speak of. \\nXXXI. Receive temporal blessings without ostentation, when they are sent and thou \\nshalt be able to part with them with all readiness and facility when they are taken \\nfrom thee again. \\nXXXII. If ever thou sawest either a hand, or a foot, or a head lying by itself, in some \\nplace or other, as cut off from the rest of the body, such must thou conceive him to \\nmake himself, as much as in him lieth, that either is offended with anything that is \\nhappened, (whatsoever it be) and as it were divides himself from it: or that commits \\nanything against the natural law of mutual correspondence, and society among men: \\nor, he that, commits any act of uncharitableness. Whosoever thou art, thou art such, \\nthou art cast forth I know not whither out of the general unity, which is according to \\nnature.

As almost all her other faculties and properties the nature of the universe \\nbath imparted unto every reasonable creature, so this in particular we have received \\nfrom her, that as whatsoever doth oppose itself unto her, and doth withstand her in \\nher purposes and intentions, she doth, though against its will and intention, bring it \\nabout to herself, to serve herself of it in the execution of her own destinated ends; \\nand so by this though not intended co-operation of it with herself makes it part of \\nherself whether it will or no. So may every reasonable creature, what crosses and \\nimpediments soever it meets with in the course of this mortal life, it may use them as \\nfit and proper objects, to the furtherance of whatsoever it intended and absolutely \\nproposed unto itself as its natural end and happiness. \\nXXXIV. Let not the general representation unto thyself of the wretchedness of this \\nour mortal life, trouble thee. Let not thy mind wander up and down, and heap to-\\ngether in her thoughts the many troubles and grievous calamities which thou art as \\nsubject unto as any other. But as everything in particular doth happen, put this \\nquestion unto thyself, and say: What is it that in this present matter, seems unto \\nthee so intolerable? For thou wilt be ashamed to confess it. Then upon this presently \\ncall to mind, that neither that which is future, nor that which is past can hurt thee; \\nbut that only which is present. (And that also is much lessened, if thou dost lightly \\ncircumscribe it): and then check thy mind if for so little a while, (a mere instant), it \\ncannot hold out with patience. \\nXXXV. What? are either Panthea or Pergamus abiding to this day by their masters’ \\ntombs? or either Chabrias or Diotimus by that of Adrianus? O foolery! For what if \\nthey did, would their masters be sensible of It? or if sensible, would they be glad of \\nit? or if glad, were these immortal? Was not it appointed unto them also (both men \\nand women), to become old in time, and then to die? And these once dead, what \\nwould become of these former? And when all is done, what is all this for, but for a \\nmere bag of blood and corruption? \\nXXXVI. If thou beest quick-sighted, be so in matter of judgment, and best discretion, \\nsaith he. \\nXXXVII. In the whole constitution of man, I see not any virtue contrary to justice, \\nwhereby it may be resisted and opposed. But one whereby pleasure and voluptuous-\\nness may be resisted and opposed, I see: continence. \\nXXXVIII. If thou canst but withdraw conceit and opinion concerning that which may \\nseem hurtful and offensive, thou thyself art as safe, as safe may be. Thou thyself? \\nand who is that? Thy reason. “Yea, but I am not reason.” Well, be it so.

That which is a hindrance of the senses, is an evil to the sensitive nature. \\nThat which is a hindrance of the appetitive and prosecutive faculty, is an evil to the \\nsensitive nature. As of the sensitive, so of the vegetative constitution, whatsoever is a \\nhindrance unto it, is also in that respect an evil unto the same. And so likewise, \\nwhatsoever is a hindrance unto the mind and understanding, must needs be the \\nproper evil of the reasonable nature. Now apply all those things unto thyself. Do ei-\\nther pain or pleasure seize on thee? Let the senses look to that. Hast thou met with \\nSome obstacle or other in thy purpose and intention? If thou didst propose without \\ndue reservation and exception now hath thy reasonable part received a blow indeed \\nBut if in general thou didst propose unto thyself what soever might be, thou art not \\nthereby either hurt, nor properly hindered. For in those things that properly belong \\nunto the mind, she cannot be hindered by any man. It is not fire, nor iron; nor the \\npower of a tyrant nor the power of a slandering tongue; nor anything else that can \\npenetrate into her. \\nXL. If once round and solid, there is no fear that ever it will change. \\nXLI. Why should I grieve myself; who never did willingly grieve any other! One thing \\nrejoices one and another thing another. As for me, this is my joy , if my understand-\\ning be right and sound, as neither averse from any man, nor refusing any of those \\nthings which as a man I am) subject unto; if I can look upon all things in the world \\nmeekly and kindly; accept all things and carry myself towards everything according \\nto true worth of the thing itself. \\nXLII. This time that is now present, bestow thou upon thyself. They that rather hunt \\nfor fame after death, do not consider, that those men that shall be hereafter, will be \\neven such, as these whom now they can so hardly bear with. And besides they also \\nwill be mortal men. But to consider the thing in itself, if so many with so many voic-\\nes, shall make such and such a sound, or shall have such and such an opinion con-\\ncerning thee, what is it to thee? \\nXLIII. Take me and throw me where thou wilt: I am indifferent. For there also I shall \\nhave that spirit which is within me propitious; that is well pleased and fully content-\\ned both in that constant disposition, and with those particular actions, which to its \\nown proper constitution are suitable and agreeable. \\nXLIV. Is this then a thing of that worth, that for it my soul should suffer, and become \\nworse than it was? as either basely dejected, or disordinately affected, or confounded \\nwithin itself, or terrified? What can there be, that thou shouldest so much esteem? \\nXLV. Nothing can happen unto thee, which is not incidental unto thee, as thou art a \\nman. As nothing can happen either to an ox, a vine, or to a stone, which is not inci-\\ndental unto them; unto every one in his own kind. If therefore nothing can happen \\nunto anything, which is not both usual and natural; why art thou displeased? Sure \\nthe common nature of all would not bring anything upon any, that were intolerable. \\nIf therefore it be a thing external that causes thy grief, know, that it is not that \\nproperly that doth cause it, but thine own conceit and opinion concerning the thing: \\nwhich thou mayest rid thyself of, when thou wilt.

How much less when by the help of reason she is able to \\njudge of things with discretion? And therefore let thy chief fort and place of defence \\nbe, a mind free from passions. A stronger place, (whereunto to make his refuge, and \\nso to become impregnable) and better fortified than this, bath no man. He that seeth \\nnot this is unlearned. He that seeth it, and betaketh not himself to this place of ref-\\nuge, is unhappy. \\nXLVII. Keep thyself to the first bare and naked apprehensions of things, as they pre-\\nsent themselves unto thee, and add not unto them. It is reported unto thee, that \\nsuch a one speaketh ill of thee. Well; that he speaketh ill of thee, so much is report-\\ned. But that thou art hurt thereby, is not reported: that is the addition of opinion, \\nwhich thou must exclude. I see that my child is sick. That he is sick, I see, but that \\nhe is in danger of his life also, I see it not. Thus thou must use to keep thyself to the \\nfirst motions and apprehensions of things, as they present themselves outwardly; \\nand add not unto them from within thyself through mere conceit and opinion. Or ra-\\nther add unto them: hut as one that understandeth the true nature of all things that \\nhappen in the world. \\nXLVIII. Is the cucumber bitter? set it away. Brambles are in the way? avoid them. Let \\nthis suffice. Add not presently speaking unto thyself, What serve these things for in \\nthe world? For, this, one that is acquainted with the mysteries of nature, will laugh \\nat thee for it; as a carpenter would or a shoemaker, if meeting in either of their shops \\nwith some shavings, or small remnants of their work, thou shouldest blame them for \\nit. And yet those men, it is not for want of a place where to throw them that they \\nkeep them in their shops for a while: but the nature of the universe hath no such \\nout-place; but herein doth consist the wonder of her art and skill, that she having \\nonce circumscribed herself within some certain bounds and limits, whatsoever is \\nwithin her that seems either corrupted, or old, or unprofitable, she can change it into \\nherself, and of these very things can make new things; so that she needeth not to \\nseek elsewhere out of herself either for a new supply of matter and substance, or for \\na place where to throw out whatsoever is irrecoverably putrid and corrupt. Thus she, \\nas for place, so for matter and art, is herself sufficient unto herself. \\nXLIX. Not to be slack and negligent; or loose, and wanton in thy actions; nor conten-\\ntious, and troublesome in thy conversation; nor to rove and wander in thy fancies \\nand imaginations. Not basely to contract thy soul; nor boisterously to sally out with \\nit, or furiously to launch out as it were, nor ever to want employment.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Safari', 'creationdate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'title': 'https:/www.maximusveritas.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations', 'author': 'Arshad Kazi', 'moddate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'source': '/content/meidtations (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 128, 'page': 74, 'page_label': '75'}, page_content=\"MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS \\nEIGHTH BOOK \\nMarcus Aurelius' Meditations - tr.

And he \\nthat knoweth not what the world was made for, cannot possibly know either what are \\nthe qualities, or what is the nature of the world. Now he that in either of these is to \\nseek, for what he himself was made is ignorant also.

Dost thou desire to be commended of that man, who thrice in one \\nhour perchance, doth himself curse himself? Dost thou desire to please him, who \\npleaseth not himself? or dost thou think that he pleaseth himself, who doth use to \\nrepent himself almost of everything that he doth? \\nLII. Not only now henceforth to have a common breath, or to hold correspondency of \\nbreath, with that air, that compasseth us about; but to have a common mind, or to \\nhold correspondency of mind also with that rational substance, which compasseth \\nall things. For, that also is of itself, and of its own nature (if a man can but draw it in \\nas he should) everywhere diffused; and passeth through all things, no less than the \\nair doth, if a man can but suck it in. \\nLIII. Wickedness in general doth not hurt the world. Particular wickedness doth not \\nhurt any other: only unto him it is hurtful, whosoever he be that offends, unto whom \\nin great favour and mercy it is granted, that whensoever he himself shall but first de-\\nsire it, he may be presently delivered of it. Unto my free-will my neighbour’s free-will, \\nwhoever he be, (as his life, or his bode), is altogether indifferent. For though we are \\nall made one for another, yet have our minds and understandings each of them their \\nown proper and limited jurisdiction. For else another man’s wickedness might be my \\nevil which God would not have, that it might not be in another man’s power to make \\nme unhappy: which nothing now can do but mine own wickedness. \\nLIV. The sun seemeth to be shed abroad. And indeed it is diffused but not effused. \\nFor that diffusion of it is a τάσις or an extension. For therefore are the beams of it \\ncalled ακτίνες from the word εκτείνεσθαι, to be stretched out and extended. Now what \\na sunbeam is, thou mayest know if thou observe the light of the sun, when through \\nsome narrow hole it pierceth into some room that is dark. For it is always in a direct \\nline. And as by any solid body, that it meets with in the way that is not penetrable by \\nair, it is divided and abrupted, and yet neither slides off, or falls down, but stayeth \\nthere nevertheless: such must the diffusion in the mind be; not an effusion, but an \\nextension.

For the nature of the universe, having \\nmade all reasonable creatures one for another, to the end that they should \\ndo one another good; more or less according to the several persons and oc-\\ncasions but in nowise hurt one another: it is manifest that he that doth transgress \\nagainst this her will, is guilty of impiety towards the most ancient and venerable of \\nall the deities. For the nature of the universe, is the nature the common parent of all, \\nand therefore piously to be observed of all things that are, and that which now is, to \\nwhatsoever first was, and gave it its being, hath relation of blood and kindred. She is \\nalso called truth and is the first cause of all truths. He therefore that willingly and \\nwittingly doth lie, is impious in that he doth receive, and so commit injustice: but he \\nthat against his will, in that he disagreeth from the nature of the universe, and in \\nthat striving with the nature of the world he doth in his particular, violate the general \\norder of the world. For he doth no better than strive and war against it, who contrary \\nto his own nature applieth himself to that which is contrary to truth. For nature had \\nbefore furnished him with instincts and opportunities sufficient for the attainment of \\nit; which he having hitherto neglected, is not now able to discern that which is false \\nfrom that which is true. He also that pursues after pleasures, as that which is truly \\ngood and flies from pains, as that which is truly evil: is impious. For such a one \\nmust of necessity oftentimes accuse that common nature, as distributing many \\nthings both unto the evil, and unto the good, not according to the deserts of either: \\nas unto the bad oftentimes pleasures, and the causes of pleasures; so unto the good, \\npains, and the occasions of pains. Again, he that feareth pains and crosses in this \\nworld, feareth some of those things which some time or other must needs happen in \\nthe world. And that we have already showed to be impious. And he that pursueth af-\\nter pleasures, will not spare, to compass his desires, to do that which is unjust, and \\nthat is manifestly impious. Now those things which unto nature are equally indiffer-\\nent (for she had not created both, both pain and pleasure, if both had not been unto \\nher equally indifferent): they that will live according to nature, must in those things \\n(as being of the same mind and disposition that she is) be as equally indifferent. \\nWhosoever therefore in either matter of pleasure and pain; death and life; honour \\nand dishonour, (which things nature in the administration of the world, indifferently \\ndoth make use of), is not as indifferent, it is apparent that he is impious. When I say \\nthat common nature doth indifferently make use of them, my meaning is, that they \\nhappen indifferently in the ordinary course of things, which by a necessary conse-\\nquence, whether as principal or accessory, come to pass in the world, according to \\nthat first and ancient deliberation of Providence, by which she from some certain be-\\nginning, did resolve upon the creation of such a world, conceiving then in her womb \\nas it were some certain rational generative seeds and faculties of things future, \\nwhether subjects, changes, successions; both such and such, and just so many. \\nII. It were indeed more happy and comfortable, for a man to depart out of this world, \\nhaving lived all his life long clear from all falsehood, dissimulation, voluptuousness, \\nand pride.

Hath not yet experience taught thee to fly from the plague? \\nFor a far greater plague is the corruption of the mind, than any certain change and \\ndistemper of the common air can be. This is a plague of creatures, as they are living \\ncreatures; but that of men as they are men or reasonable. \\nIII. Thou must not in matter of death carry thyself scornfully, but as one that is well \\npleased with it, as being one of those things that nature hath appointed. For what \\nthou dost conceive of these, of a boy to become a young man, to wax old, to grow, to \\nripen, to get teeth, or a beard, or grey hairs to beget, to bear, or to be delivered; or \\nwhat other action soever it be, that is natural unto man according to the several sea-\\nsons of his life; such a thing is it also to he dissolved. It is therefore the part of a wise \\nman, in matter of death, not in any wise to carry himself either violently, or proudly \\nbut patiently to wait for it, as one of nature’s operations: that with the same mind as \\nnow thou dost expect when that which yet is but an embryo in thy wife’s belly shall \\ncome forth, thou mayst expect also when thy soul shall fall off from that outward \\ncoat or skin: wherein as a child in the belly it lieth involved and shut up. But thou \\ndesirest a more popular, and though not so direct and philosophical, yet a very pow-\\nerful and penetrative recipe against the fear of death, nothing can make they more \\nwilling to part with thy life, than if thou shalt consider, both what the subjects them-\\nselves are that thou shalt part with, and what manner of disposition thou shalt no \\nmore have to do with. True it is, that. offended with them thou must not be by no \\nmeans, but take care of them, and meekly bear with them However, this thou mayst \\nremember, that whensoever it happens that thou depart, it shall not be from men \\nthat held the same opinions that thou dost. For that indeed, (if it were so) is the only \\nthing that might make thee averse from death, and willing to continue here, if it were \\nthy hap to live with men that had obtained the same belief that thou hast. But now, \\nwhat a toil it is for thee to live with men of different opinions, thou seest: so that \\nthou hast rather occasion to say, Hasten, I thee pray, O Death; lest I also in time for-\\nget myself. \\nIV. He that sinneth, sinneth unto himself. He that is unjust, hurts himself, in that he \\nmakes himself worse than he was before. Not he only that committeth, but he also \\nthat omitteth something, is oftentimes unjust. \\nV.

Of all unreasonable creatures, there is but one unreasonable soul; and of all that \\nare reasonable, but one reasonable soul, divided betwixt them all. As of all earthly \\nthings there is but one earth, and but one light that we see by; and but one air that \\nwe breathe in, as many as either breathe or see. Now whatsoever partakes of some \\ncommon thing, naturally affects and inclines unto that whereof it is part, being of \\none kind and nature with it.

Whatsoever is fiery, doth not only by reason of the ele-\\nmentary fire tend upwards; but here also is so ready to join, and to burn together, \\nthat whatsoever doth want sufficient moisture to make resistance, is easily set on \\nfire. Whatsoever therefore is partaker of that reasonable common nature, naturally \\ndoth as much and more long after his own kind. For by how much in its own nature \\nit excels all other things, by so much more is it desirous to be joined and united unto \\nthat, which is of its own nature. As for unreasonable creatures then, they had not \\nlong been, but presently begun among them swarms, and flocks, and broods of \\nyoung ones, and a kind of mutual love and affection. For though but unreasonable, \\nyet a kind of soul these had, and therefore was that natural desire of union more \\nstrong and intense in them, as in creatures of a more excellent nature, than either in \\nplants, or stones, or trees. But among reasonable creatures, begun commonwealths, \\nfriendships, families, public meetings, and even in their wars, conventions, and truc-\\nes. Now among them that were yet of a more excellent nature, as the stars and plan-\\nets, though by their nature far distant one from another, yet even among them began \\nsome mutual correspondency and unity. So proper is it to excellency in a high degree \\nto affect unity, as that even in things so far distant, it could operate unto a mutual \\nsympathy. But now behold, what is now come to pass. Those creatures that are rea-\\nsonable, are now the only creatures that have forgotten their natural affection and \\ninclination of one towards another. Among them alone of all other things that are of \\none kind, there is not to be found a general disposition to flow together. But though \\nthey fly from nature, yet are they stopt in their course, and apprehended. Do they \\nwhat they can, nature doth prevail. And so shalt thou confess, if thou dost observe it. \\nFor sooner mayst thou find a thing earthly, where no earthly thing is, than find a \\nman that naturally can live by himself alone. \\nVIII. Man, God, the world, every one in their kind, bear some fruits. All things have \\ntheir proper time to bear. Though by custom, the word itself is in a manner become \\nproper unto the vine, and the like, yet is it so nevertheless, as we have said. As for \\nreason, that beareth both common fruit for the use of others; and peculiar, which \\nitself doth enjoy. Reason is of a diffusive nature, what itself is in itself, it begets in \\nothers, and so doth multiply. \\nIX. Either teach them better if it be in thy power; or if it be not, remember that for \\nthis use, to bear with them patiently, was mildness and goodness granted unto thee. \\nThe Gods themselves are good unto such; yea and in some things, (as in matter of \\nhealth, of wealth, of honour), are content often to further their endeavours: so good \\nand gracious are they. And mightest thou not be so too? or, tell me, what doth hinder \\nthee? \\nX. Labour not as one to whom it is appointed to be wretched, nor as one that either \\nwould be pitied, or admired; but let this be thine only care and desire; so always and \\nin all things to prosecute or to forbear, as the law of charity, or mutual society doth \\nrequire. \\nXI. This day I did come out of all my trouble. Nay I have cast out all my trouble; it \\nshould rather be for that which troubled thee, whatsoever it was, was not without \\nanywhere that thou shouldest come out of it, but within in thine own opinions, from \\nwhence it must be cast out, before thou canst truly and constantly be at ease.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Safari', 'creationdate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'title': 'https:/www.maximusveritas.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations', 'author': 'Arshad Kazi', 'moddate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'source': '/content/meidtations (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 128, 'page': 79, 'page_label': '80'}, page_content=\"MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS \\nNINTH BOOK \\nMarcus Aurelius' Meditations - tr.

The things themselves that affect us, they stand without doors, neither knowing \\nanything themselves nor able to utter anything unto others concerning themselves. \\nWhat then is it, that passeth verdict on them?

Sift their minds and understandings, and behold what men they be, whom thou \\ndost stand in fear of what they shall judge of thee, what they themselves judge of \\nthemselves. \\nXVII. All things that are in the world, are always in the estate of alteration. Thou also \\nart in a perpetual change, yea and under corruption too, in some part: and so is the \\nwhole world. \\nXVIII. It is not thine, but another man’s sin. Why should it trouble thee? Let him look \\nto it, whose sin it is. \\nXIX. Of an operation and of a purpose there is an ending, or of an action and of a \\npurpose we say commonly, that it is at an end: from opinion also there is an absolute \\ncessation, which is as it were the death of it. In all this there is no hurt. Apply this \\nnow to a man’s age, as first, a child; then a youth, then a young man, then an old \\nman; every change from one age to another is a kind of death And all this while here \\nno matter of grief yet. Pass now unto that life first, that which thou livedst under thy \\ngrandfather, then under thy mother, then under thy father. And thus when through \\nthe whole course of thy life hitherto thou hast found and observed many alterations, \\nmany changes, many kinds of endings and cessations, put this question to thyself \\nWhat matter of grief or sorrow dost thou find in any of these? Or what doest thou \\nsuffer through any of these? If in none of these, then neither in the ending and con-\\nsummation of thy whole life, which is also but a cessation and change. \\nXX. As occasion shall require, either to thine own understanding, or to that of the \\nuniverse, or to his, whom thou hast now to do with, let thy refuge be with all speed. \\nTo thine own, that it resolve upon nothing against justice. To that of the universe, \\nthat thou mayest remember, part of whom thou art. Of his, that thou mayest consid-\\ner. whether in the estate of ignorance, or of knowledge. And then also must thou call \\nto mind, that he is thy kinsman. \\nXXI. As thou thyself, whoever thou art, were made for the perfection and consumma-\\ntion, being a member of it, of a common society; so must every action of thine tend to \\nthe perfection and consummation of a life that is truly sociable.

Go to the quality of the cause from which the effect doth proceed. Behold it by \\nitself bare and naked, separated from all that is material. Then consider the utmost \\nbounds of time that that cause, thus and thus qualified, can subsist and abide. \\nXXIV. Infinite are the troubles and miseries, that thou hast already been put to, by \\nreason of this only, because that for all happiness it did not suffice thee, or, that \\nthou didst not account it sufficient happiness, that thy understanding did operate \\naccording to its natural constitution. \\nXXV. When any shall either impeach thee with false accusations, or hatefully re-\\nproach thee, or shall use any such carriage towards thee, get thee presently to their \\nminds and understandings, and look in them, and behold what manner of men they \\nbe. Thou shalt see, that there is no such occasion why it should trouble thee, what \\nsuch as they are think of thee. Yet must thou love them still, for by nature they are \\nthy friends. And the Gods themselves, in those things that they seek from them as \\nmatters of great moment, are well content, all manner of ways, as by dreams and or-\\nacles, to help them as well as others. \\nXXVI. Up and down, from one age to another, go the ordinary things of the world; be-\\ning still the same. And either of everything in particular before it come to pass, the \\nmind of the universe doth consider with itself and deliberate: and if so, then submit \\nfor shame unto the determination of such an excellent understanding: or once for all \\nit did resolve upon all things in general; and since that whatsoever happens, hap-\\npens by a necessary consequence, and all things indivisibly in a manner and insepa-\\nrably hold one of another. In sum, either there is a God, and then all is well; or if all \\nthings go by chance and fortune, yet mayest thou use thine own providence in those \\nthings that concern thee properly; and then art thou well. \\nXXVII. Within a while the earth shall cover us all, and then she herself shall have her \\nchange. And then the course will be, from one period of eternity unto another, and so \\na perpetual eternity. Now can any man that shall consider with himself in his mind \\nthe several rollings or successions of so many changes and alterations, and the \\nswiftness of all these rulings; can he otherwise but contemn in his heart and despise \\nall worldly things? The cause of the universe is as it were a strong torrent, it carrieth \\nall away. \\nXXVIII. And these your professed politicians, the only true practical philosophers of \\nthe world, (as they think of themselves) so full of affected gravity, or such professed \\nlovers of virtue and honesty, what wretches be they in very deed; how vile and con-\\ntemptible in themselves? O man! what ado doest thou keep? Do what thy nature \\ndoth now require. Resolve upon it, if thou mayest: and take no thought, whether an-\\nybody shall know it or no.

From some high place as it were to look down, and to behold here flocks, and \\nthere sacrifices, without number; and all kind of navigation; some in a rough and \\nstormy sea, and some in a calm: the general differences, or different estates of \\nthings, some, that are now first upon being; the several and mutual relations of \\nthose things that are together; and some other things that are at their last. Their \\nlives also, who were long ago, and theirs who shall be hereafter, and the present es-\\ntate and life of those many nations of barbarians that are now in the world, thou \\nmust likewise consider in thy mind. And how many there be, who never so much as \\nheard of thy name, how many that will soon forget it; how many who but even now \\ndid commend thee, within a very little while perchance will speak ill of thee. So that \\nneither fame, nor honour, nor anything else that this world doth afford, is worth the \\nwhile. The sum then of all; whatsoever doth happen unto thee, whereof God is the \\ncause, to accept it contentedly: whatsoever thou doest, whereof thou thyself art the \\ncause, to do it justly: which will be, if both in thy resolution and in thy action thou \\nhave no further end, than to do good unto others, as being that, which by thy natu-\\nral constitution, as a man, thou art bound unto. \\nXXX. Many of those things that trouble and straiten thee, it is in thy power to cut off, \\nas wholly depending from mere conceit and opinion; and then thou shalt have room \\nenough. \\nXXXI. To comprehend the whole world together in thy mind, and the whole course of \\nthis present age to represent it unto thyself, and to fix thy thoughts upon the sudden \\nchange of every particular object. How short the time is from the generation of any-\\nthing, unto the dissolution of the same; but how immense and infinite both that \\nwhich was before the generation, and that which after the generation of it shall be. \\nAll things that thou seest, will soon be perished, and they that see their corruptions, \\nwill soon vanish away themselves. He that dieth a hundred years old, and he that \\ndieth young, shall come all to one. \\nXXXII. What are their minds and understandings; and what the things that they ap-\\nply themselves unto: what do they love, and what do they hate for? Fancy to thyself \\nthe estate of their souls openly to be seen. When they think they hurt them shrewdly, \\nwhom they speak ill of; and when they think they do them a very good turn, whom \\nthey commend and extol: O how full are they then of conceit, and opinion! \\nXXXIII. Loss and corruption, is in very deed nothing else but change and alteration; \\nand that is it, which the nature of the universe doth most delight in, by which, and \\naccording to which, whatsoever is done, is well done.

Thy life \\nitself, is some such thing too; a mere exhalation of blood: and it also, apt to be \\nchanged into some other common thing. \\nXXXV. Will this querulousness, this murmuring, this complaining and dissembling \\nnever be at an end? What then is it, that troubleth thee? Doth any new thing happen \\nunto thee? What doest thou so wonder at? At the cause, or the matter? Behold either \\nby itself, is either of that weight and moment indeed? And besides these, there is not \\nanything. But thy duty towards the Gods also, it is time thou shouldst acquit thyself \\nof it with more goodness and simplicity. \\nXXXVI. It is all one to see these things for a hundred of years together or but for \\nthree years. \\nXXXVII. If he have sinned, his is the harm, not mine. But perchance he hath not. \\nXXXVIII. Either all things by the providence of reason happen unto every particular, \\nas a part of one general body; and then it is against reason that a part should com-\\nplain of anything that happens for the good of the whole; or if, according to Epicurus, \\natoms be the cause of all things and that life be nothing else but an accidentary con-\\nfusion of things, and death nothing else, but a mere dispersion and so of all other \\nthings: what doest thou trouble thyself for? \\nXXXIX. Sayest thou unto that rational part, Thou art dead; corruption hath taken \\nhold on thee? Doth it then also void excrements? Doth it like either oxen, or sheep, \\ngraze or feed; that it also should be mortal, as well as the body? \\nXL. Either the Gods can do nothing for us at all, or they can still and allay all the \\ndistractions and distempers of thy mind. If they can do nothing, why doest thou \\npray? If they can, why wouldst not thou rather pray, that they will grant unto thee, \\nthat thou mayst neither fear, nor lust after any of those worldly things which cause \\nthese distractions and distempers of it? Why not rather, that thou mayst not at ei-\\nther their absence or presence, be grieved and discontented: than either that thou \\nmayst obtain them, or that thou mayst avoid them? For certainly it must needs be, \\nthat if the Gods can help us in anything, they may in this kind also. But thou wilt \\nsay perchance, “In those things the Gods have given me my liberty: and it is in mine \\nown power to do what I will.” But if thou mayst use this liberty, rather to set thy \\nmind at true liberty, than wilfully with baseness and servility of mind to affect those \\nthings, which either to compass or to avoid is not in thy power, wert not thou better? \\nAnd as for the Gods, who hath told thee, that they may not help us up even in those \\nthings that they have put in our own power? whether it be so or no, thou shalt soon\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Safari', 'creationdate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'title': 'https:/www.maximusveritas.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations', 'author': 'Arshad Kazi', 'moddate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'source': '/content/meidtations (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 128, 'page': 83, 'page_label': '84'}, page_content=\"MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS \\nNINTH BOOK \\nMarcus Aurelius' Meditations - tr.

Nei-\\nther did I leave the ordering of my body to the physicians altogether to do with me \\nwhat they would, as though I expected any great matter from them, or as though I \\nthought it a matter of such great consequence, by their means to recover my health: \\nfor my present estate, methought, liked me very well, and gave me good content.” \\nWhether therefore in sickness (if thou chance to sicken) or in what other kind of ex-\\ntremity soever, endeavour thou also to be in thy mind so affected, as he doth report \\nof himself: not to depart from thy philosophy for anything that can befall thee, nor to \\ngive ear to the discourses of silly people, and mere naturalists. \\nXLII. It is common to all trades and professions to mind and intend that only, which \\nnow they are about, and the instrument whereby they work. \\nXLIII. When at any time thou art offended with any one’s impudency, put presently \\nthis question to thyself: “What? Is it then possible, that there should not be any im-\\npudent men in the world! Certainly it is not possible.” Desire not then that which is \\nimpossible. For this one, (thou must think) whosoever he be, is one of those impu-\\ndent ones, that the world cannot be without. So of the subtile and crafty, so of the \\nperfidious, so of every one that offendeth, must thou ever be ready to reason with \\nthyself. For whilst in general thou dost thus reason with thyself, that the kind of \\nthem must needs be in the world, thou wilt be the better able to use meekness to-\\nwards every particular. This also thou shalt find of very good use, upon every such \\noccasion, presently to consider with thyself, what proper virtue nature hath fur-\\nnished man with, against such a vice, or to encounter with a disposition vicious in \\nthis kind. As for example, against the unthankful, it hath given goodness and meek-\\nness, as an antidote, and so against another vicious in another kind some other pe-\\nculiar faculty. And generally, is it not in thy power to instruct him better, that is in \\nan error? For whosoever sinneth, doth in that decline from his purposed end, and is \\ncertainly deceived, And again, what art thou the worse for his sin? For thou shalt not \\nfind that any one of these, against whom thou art incensed, hath in very deed done \\nanything whereby thy mind (the only true subject of thy hurt and evil) can be made \\nworse than it was. And what a matter of either grief or wonder is this, if he that is \\nunlearned, do the deeds of one that is unlearned?

Thou shalt one day be full, and in want of no external \\nthing: not seeking pleasure from anything, either living or insensible, that this world \\ncan afford; neither wanting time for the continuation of thy pleasure, nor place and \\nopportunity, nor the favour either of the weather or of men.

As one who is altogether governed by nature, let it be thy care to observe what it is \\nthat thy nature in general doth require. That done, if thou find not that thy nature, \\nas thou art a living sensible creature, will be the worse for it, thou mayest proceed. \\nNext then thou must examine, what thy nature as thou art a living sensible creature, \\ndoth require. And that, whatsoever it be, thou mayest admit of and do it, if thy na-\\nture as thou art a reasonable living creature, will not be the worse for it.

Either with Epicurus, we must fondly imagine the atoms to be the cause of all \\nthings, or we must needs grant a nature. Let this then be thy first ground, that thou \\nart part of that universe, which is governed by nature. Then secondly, that to those \\nparts that are of the same kind and nature as thou art, thou hast relation of kindred. \\nFor of these, if I shall always be mindful, first as I am a part, I shall never be dis-\\npleased with anything, that falls to my particular share of the common chances of \\nthe world. For nothing that is behoveful unto the whole, can be truly hurtful to that \\nwhich is part of it. For this being the common privilege of all natures, that they con-\\ntain nothing in themselves that is hurtful unto them; it cannot be that the nature of \\nthe universe (whose privilege beyond other particular natures, is, that she cannot \\nagainst her will by any higher external cause be constrained), should beget anything \\nand cherish it in her bosom that should tend to her own hurt and prejudice. As then \\nI bear in mind that I am a part of such an universe, I shall not be displeased with \\nanything that happens. And as I have relation of kindred to those parts that are of \\nthe same kind and nature that I am, so I shall be careful to do nothing that is preju-\\ndicial to the community, but in all my deliberations shall they that are of my kind \\never be; and the common good, that, which all my intentions and resolutions shall \\ndrive unto, as that which is contrary unto it, I shall by all means endeavour to pre-\\nvent and avoid. These things once so fixed and concluded, as thou wouldst think him \\na happy citizen, whose constant study and practice were for the good and benefit of \\nhis fellow citizens, and the carriage of the city such towards him, that he were well \\npleased with it; so must it needs be with thee, that thou shalt live a happy life. \\nVII. All parts of the world, (all things I mean that are contained within the whole \\nworld, must of necessity at some time or other come to corruption. Alteration I \\nshould say, to speak truly and properly; but that I may be the better understood, I \\nam content at this time to use that more common word. Now say I, if so be that this \\nbe both hurtful unto them, and yet unavoidable, would not, thinkest thou, the whole \\nitself be in a sweet case, all the parts of it being subject to alteration, yea and by \\ntheir making itself fitted for corruption, as consisting of things different and contra-\\nry? And did nature then either of herself thus project and purpose the affliction and \\nmisery of her parts, and therefore of purpose so made them, not only that haply they \\nmight, but of necessity that they should fall into evil; or did not she know what she \\ndid, when she made them? For either of these two to say, is equally absurd. But to \\nlet pass nature in general, and to reason of things particular according to their own \\nparticular natures; how absurd and ridiculous is it, first to say that all parts of the \\nwhole are, by their proper natural constitution, subject to alteration; and then when \\nany such thing doth happen, as when one doth fall sick and dieth, to take on and \\nwonder as though some strange thing had happened? Though this besides might \\nmove not so grievously to take on when any such thing doth happen, that whatsoev-\\ner is dissolved, it is dissolved into those things, whereof it was compounded. For eve-\\nry dissolution is either a mere dispersion, of the elements into those elements again \\nwhereof everything did consist, or a change, of that which is more solid into earth; \\nand of that which is pure and subtile or spiritual, into air. So that by this means \\nnothing is lost, but all resumed again into those rational generative seeds of the uni-\\nverse; and this universe, either after a certain period of time to lie consumed by fire, \\nor by continual changes to be renewed, and so for ever to endure.

For alas! all this that now thou art in either kind, \\neither for matter of substance, or of life, hath but two or three days ago partly from \\nmeats eaten, and partly from air breathed in, received all its influx, being the same \\nthen in no other respect, than a running river, maintained by the perpetual influx \\nand new supply of waters, is the same. That therefore which thou hast since re-\\nceived, not that which came from thy mother, is that which comes to change and \\ncorruption. But suppose that that for the general substance, and more solid part of \\nit, should still cleave unto thee never so close, yet what is that to the proper qualities \\nand affections of it, by which persons are distinguished, which certainly are quite dif-\\nferent? \\nVIII. Now that thou hast taken these names upon thee of good, modest, true; of \\nέμφρων, σύμφρων, υπέρφρων; take heed lest at any times by doing anything that is \\ncontrary, thou be but improperly so called, and lose thy right to these appellations. \\nOr if thou do, return unto them again with all possible speed. And remember, that \\nthe word έμφρων notes unto thee an intent and intelligent consideration of every ob-\\nject that presents itself unto thee, without distraction. And the word σύμφρων, a \\nready and contented acceptation of whatsoever by the appointment of the common \\nnature, happens unto thee. And the word υπέρφρων, a super-extension, or a trans-\\ncendent, and outreaching disposition of thy mind, whereby it passeth by all bodily \\npains and pleasures, honour and credit, death and whatsoever is of the same nature, \\nas matters of absolute indifferency, and in no wise to be stood upon by a wise man. \\nThese then if inviolably thou shalt observe, and shalt not be ambitious to be so called \\nby others, both thou thyself shalt become a new man, and thou shalt begin a new \\nlife. For to continue such as hitherto thou hast been, to undergo those distractions \\nand distempers as thou must needs for such a life as hitherto thou hast lived, is the \\npart of one that is very foolish, and is overfond of his life. Whom a man might com-\\npare to one of those half-eaten wretches, matched in the amphitheatre with wild \\nbeasts; who as full as they are all the body over with wounds and blood, desire for a \\ngreat favour, that they may be reserved till the next day, then also, and in the same \\nestate to be exposed to the same nails and teeth as before. Away therefore, ship thy-\\nself; and from the troubles and distractions of thy former life convey thyself as it were \\nunto these few names; and if thou canst abide in them, or be constant in the practice \\nand possession of them, continue there as glad and joyful as one that were translat-\\ned unto some such place of bliss and happiness as that which by Hesiod and Plato is \\ncalled the Islands of the Blessed, by others called the Elysian Fields. And whensoever \\nthou findest thyself; that thou art in danger of a relapse, and that thou art not able \\nto master and overcome those difficulties and temptations that present themselves in \\nthy present station: get thee into any private corner, where thou mayst be better \\nable. Or if that will not serve forsake even thy life rather. But so that it be not in pas-\\nsion but in a plain voluntary modest way: this being the only commendable action of \\nthy whole life that thus thou art departed, or this having been the main work and \\nbusiness of thy whole life, that thou mightest thus depart. Now for the better re-\\nmembrance of those names that we have spoken of, thou shalt find it a very good \\nhelp, to remember the Gods as often as may be: and that, the thing which they re-\\nquire at our hands of as many of us, as are by nature reasonable creation is not that\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Safari', 'creationdate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'title': 'https:/www.maximusveritas.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations', 'author': 'Arshad Kazi', 'moddate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'source': '/content/meidtations (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 128, 'page': 88, 'page_label': '89'}, page_content=\"MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS \\nTENTH BOOK \\nMarcus Aurelius' Meditations - tr.

Whereas thou shouldst in \\nall things so join action and contemplation, that thou mightest both at the same time \\nattend all present occasions, to perform everything duly and carefully and yet so in-\\ntend the contemplative part too, that no part of that delight and pleasure, which the \\ncontemplative knowledge of everything according to its true nature doth of itself af-\\nford, might be lost. Or, that the true and contemplative knowledge of everything ac-\\ncording to its own nature, might of itself, (action being subject to many lets and im-\\npediments) afford unto thee sufficient pleasure and happiness. Not apparent indeed, \\nbut not concealed. And when shalt thou attain to the happiness of true simplicity, \\nand unaffected gravity? When shalt thou rejoice in the certain knowledge of every \\nparticular object according to its true nature: as what the matter and substance of it \\nis; what use it is for in the world: how long it can subsist: what things it doth consist \\nof: who they be that are capable of it, and who they that can give it, and take it \\naway? \\nX. As the spider, when it hath caught the fly that it hunted after, is not little proud, \\nnor meanly conceited of herself: as he likewise that hath caught an hare, or hath \\ntaken a fish with his net: as another for the taking of a boar, and another of a bear: \\nso may they be proud, and applaud themselves for their valiant acts against the \\nSarmatæ, or northern nations lately defeated. For these also, these famous soldiers \\nand warlike men, if thou dost look into their minds and opinions, what do they for \\nthe most part but hunt after prey? \\nXI. To find out, and set to thyself some certain way and method of contemplation, \\nwhereby thou mayest clearly discern and represent unto thyself, the mutual change \\nof all things, the one into the other.

He hath got loose from the bonds of his body, and perceiving that within a very \\nlittle while he must of necessity bid the world farewell, and leave all these things be-\\nhind him, he wholly applied himself, as to righteousness in all his actions, so to the \\ncommon nature in all things that should happen unto him. And contenting himself \\nwith these two things, to do all things justly, and whatsoever God doth send to like \\nwell of it: what others shall either say or think of him, or shall do against him, he \\ndoth not so much as trouble his thoughts with it.

In the morning as soon as thou art awaked, when thy judgment, before either \\nthy affections, or external objects have wrought upon it, is yet most free and impar-\\ntial: put this question to thyself, whether if that which is right and just be done, the \\ndoing of it by thyself, or by others when thou art not able thyself; be a thing material \\nor no. For sure it is not. And as for these that keep such a life, and stand so much \\nupon the praises, or dispraises of other men, hast thou forgotten what manner of \\nmen they be? that such and such upon their beds, and such at their board: what \\ntheir ordinary actions are: what they pursue after, and what they fly from: what \\nthefts and rapines they commit, if not with their hands and feet, yet with that more \\nprecious part of theirs, their minds: which (would it but admit of them) might enjoy \\nfaith, modesty, truth, justice, a good spirit. \\nXVI.

And it is not out of a stout and \\nperemptory resolution, that he saith it, but in mere love, and humble submission. \\nXVII. So live as indifferent to the world and all worldly objects, as one who liveth by \\nhimself alone upon some desert hill. For whether here, or there, if the whole world be \\nbut as one town, it matters not much for the place.

That is best for every one, that the common nature of all doth send unto every \\none, and then is it best, when she doth send it. \\nXXII. The earth, saith the poet,36 doth often long after the rain. So is the glorious sky \\noften as desirous to fall upon the earth, which argues a mutual kind of love between \\nthem. And so (say I) doth the world bear a certain affection of love to whatsoever \\nshall come to pass With thine affections shall mine concur, O world. The same (and \\nno other) shall the object of my longing be which is of thine. Now that the world doth \\nlove it is true indeed so is it as commonly said, and acknowledged ledged, when, ac-\\ncording to the Greek phrase, imitated by the Latins, of things that used to be, we say \\ncommonly, that they love to be.37 \\nXXIII. Either thou dost Continue in this kind of life and that is it, which so long thou \\nhast been used unto and therefore tolerable: or thou doest retire, or leave the world, \\nand that of thine own accord, and then thou hast thy mind: or thy life is cut off; and \\nthen mayst. thou rejoice that thou hast ended thy charge. One of these must needs \\nbe. Be therefore of good comfort. \\nXXIV. Let it always appear and be manifest unto thee that solitariness, and desert \\nplaces, by many philosophers so much esteemed of and affected, are of themselves \\nbut thus and thus; and that all things are them to them that live in towns, and con-\\nverse with others as they are the same nature everywhere to be seen and observed: \\nto them that have retired themselves to the top of mountains, and to desert havens, \\nor what other desert and inhabited places soever. For anywhere it thou wilt mayest \\nthou quickly find and apply that to thyself; which Plato38 saith of his philosopher, in \\na place: as private and retired, saith he, as if he were shut up and enclosed about in \\nsome shepherd’s lodge, on the top of a hill.

What is now the present estate of it, as I use it; and \\nwhat is it, that I employ it about? Is it now void of reason or no? Is it free, and sepa-\\nrated; or so affixed, so congealed and grown together as it were with the flesh, that it \\nis swayed by the motions and inclinations of it? \\nXXV.

Whatsoever then is either sorry, \\nangry, or afraid, is a fugitive. \\nXXVI. From man is the seed, that once cast into the womb man hath no more to do \\nwith it. Another cause succeedeth, and undertakes the work, and in time brings a \\nchild (that wonderful effect from such a beginning!) to perfection. Again, man lets \\nfood down through his throat; and that once down, he hath no more to do with it. \\nAnother cause succeedeth and distributeth this food into the senses, and the affec-\\ntions: into life, and into strength; and doth with it those other many and marvellous \\nthings, that belong unto man. These things therefore that are so secretly and invisi-\\nbly wrought and brought to pass, thou must use to behold and contemplate; and not \\nthe things themselves only, but the power also by which they are effected; that thou \\nmayst behold it, though not with the eyes of the body, yet as plainly and visibly as \\nthou canst see and discern the outward efficient cause of the depression and eleva-\\ntion of anything. \\nXXVII. Ever to mind and consider with thyself; how all things that now are, have \\nbeen heretofore much after the same sort, and after the same fashion that now they \\nare: and so to think of those things which shall be hereafter also. Moreover, whole \\ndramata, and uniform scenes, or scenes that comprehend the lives and actions of \\nmen of one calling and profession, as many as either in thine own experience thou \\nhast known, or by reading of ancient histories; (as the whole court of Adrianus, the \\nwhole court of Antoninus Pius, the whole court of Philippus, that of Alexander, that \\nof Croesus): to set them all before thine eyes. For thou shalt find that they are all but \\nafter one sort and fashion: only that the actors were others. \\nXXVIII. As a pig that cries and flings when his throat is cut, fancy to thyself every \\none to be, that grieves for any worldly thing and takes on. Such a one is he also, who \\nupon his bed alone, doth bewail the miseries of this our mortal life. And remember \\nthis, that Unto reasonable creatures only it is granted that they may willingly and \\nfreely submit unto Providence: but absolutely to submit, is a necessity imposed upon \\nall creatures equally. \\nXXIX. Whatsoever it is that thou goest about, consider of it by thyself, and ask thy-\\nself, What? because I shall do this no more when I am dead, should therefore death \\nseem grievous unto me? \\nXXX. When thou art offended with any man’s transgression, presently reflect upon \\nthyself; and consider what thou thyself art guilty of in the same kind. As that thou \\nalso perchance dost think it a happiness either to be rich, or to live in pleasure, or to \\nbe praised and commended, and so of the rest in particular. For this if thou shalt call \\nto mind, thou shalt soon forget thine anger; especially when at the same time this \\nalso shall concur in thy thoughts, that he was constrained by his error and igno-\\nrance so to do: for how can he choose as long as he is of that opinion? Do thou there-\\nfore if thou canst, take away that from him, that forceth him to do as he doth. \\nXXXI. When thou seest Satyro, think of Socraticus and Eutyches, or Hymen, and \\nwhen Euphrates, think of Eutychio, and Sylvanus, when Alciphron, of Tropaeo-\\nphorus, when Xenophon, of Crito, or Severus.

Then let \\nthis come to thy mind at the same time; and where now are they all? Nowhere or an-\\nywhere? For so shalt thou at all time. be able to perceive how all worldly things are \\nbut as the smoke, that vanisheth away: or, indeed, mere nothing. Especially when \\nthou shalt call to mind this also, that whatsoever is once changed, shall never be \\nagain as long as the world endureth. And thou then, how long shalt thou endure? \\nAnd why doth it not suffice thee, if virtuously, and as becometh thee, thou mayest \\npass that portion of time, how little soever it be, that is allotted unto thee? \\nXXXII. What a subject, and what a course of life is it, that thou doest so much desire \\nto be rid of. For all these things, what are they, but fit objects for an understanding, \\nthat beholdeth everything according to its true nature, to exercise itself upon? Be pa-\\ntient, therefore, until that (as a strong stomach that turns all things into his own na-\\nture; and as a great fire that turneth in flame and light, whatsoever thou doest cast \\ninto it) thou have made these things also familiar, and as it were natural unto thee. \\nXXXIII. Let it not be in any man’s power, to say truly of thee, that thou art not truly \\nsimple, or sincere and open, or not good. Let him be deceived whosoever he be that \\nshall have any such opinion of thee. For all this doth depend of thee. For who is it \\nthat should hinder thee from being either truly simple or good? Do thou only resolve \\nrather not to live, than not to be such. For indeed neither doth it stand with reason \\nthat he should live that is not such. What then is it that may upon this present occa-\\nsion according to best reason and discretion, either be said or done? For whatsoever \\nit be, it is in thy power either to do it, or to say it, and therefore seek not any pre-\\ntences, as though thou wert hindered. Thou wilt never cease groaning and complain-\\ning, until such time as that, what pleasure is unto the voluptuous, be unto thee, to \\ndo in everything that presents itself, whatsoever may be done conformably and \\nagreeably to the proper constitution of man, or, to man as he is a man. For thou \\nmust account that pleasure, whatsoever it be, that thou mayest do according to \\nthine own nature. And to do this, every place will fit thee. Unto the cylindrus, or roll-\\ner, it is not granted to move everywhere according to its own proper motion, as nei-\\nther unto the water, nor unto the fire, nor unto any other thing, that either is merely \\nnatural, or natural and sensitive; but not rational. for many things there be that can \\nhinder their operations. But of the mind and understanding this is the proper privi-\\nlege, that according to its own nature, and as it will itself, it can pass through every \\nobstacle that it finds, and keep straight on forwards. Setting therefore before thine \\neyes this happiness and felicity of thy mind, whereby it is able to pass through all \\nthings, and is capable of all motions, whether as the fire, upwards; or as the stone \\ndownwards, or as the cylindrus through that which is sloping: content thyself with it, \\nand seek not after any other thing. For all other kind of hindrances that are not hin-\\ndrances of thy mind either they are proper to the body, or merely proceed from the \\nopinion, reason not making that resistance that it should, but basely, and cowardly \\nsuffering itself to be foiled; and of themselves can neither wound, nor do any hurt at \\nall. Else must he of necessity, whosoever he be that meets with any of them, become \\nworse than he was before. For so is it in all other subjects, that that is thought hurt-\\nful unto them, whereby they are made worse. But here contrariwise, man (if he make \\nthat good use of them that he should) is rather the better and the more praiseworthy \\nfor any of those kind of hindrances, than otherwise. But generally remember that\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Safari', 'creationdate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'title': 'https:/www.maximusveritas.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations', 'author': 'Arshad Kazi', 'moddate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'source': '/content/meidtations (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 128, 'page': 93, 'page_label': '94'}, page_content=\"MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS \\nTENTH BOOK \\nMarcus Aurelius' Meditations - tr.

But none of these casual-\\nties, or external hindrances, do hurt the law itself; or, are contrary to that course of \\njustice and equity, by which public societies are maintained: neither therefore do \\nthey hurt either city or citizen. \\nXXXIV. As he that is bitten by a mad dog, is afraid of everything almost that he \\nseeth: so unto him, whom the dogmata have once bitten, or in whom true knowledge \\nhath made an impression, everything almost that he sees or reads be it never so \\nshort or ordinary, doth afford a good memento; to put him out of all grief and fear, as \\nthat of the poet,39 “The winds blow upon the trees, and their leaves fall upon the \\nground. Then do the trees begin to bud again, and by the spring-time they put forth \\nnew branches. So is the generation of men; some come into the world, and others go \\nout of it.” Of these leaves then thy children are. And they also that applaud thee so \\ngravely, or, that applaud thy speeches, with that their usual acclamation, αξιοπίστως, \\nO wisely spoken I and speak well of thee, as on the other side, they that stick not to \\ncurse thee, they that privately and secretly dispraise and deride thee, they also are \\nbut leaves. And they also that shall follow, in whose memories the names of men fa-\\nmous after death, is preserved, they are but leaves neither. For even so is it of all \\nthese worldly things. Their spring comes, and they are put forth. Then blows the \\nwind, and they go down. And then in lieu of them grow others out of the wood40 or \\ncommon matter of all things, like unto them. But, to endure but for a while, is com-\\nmon unto all. Why then shouldest thou so earnestly either seek after these things, or \\nfly from them, as though they should endure for ever? Yet a little while, and thine \\neyes will be closed up, and for him that carries thee to thy grave shall another mourn \\nwithin a while after. \\nXXXV. A good eye must be good to see whatsoever is to be seen, and not green things \\nonly. For that is proper to sore eyes. So must a good ear, and a good smell be ready \\nfor whatsoever is either to be heard, or smelt: and a good stomach as indifferent to \\nall kinds of food, as a millstone is, to whatsoever she was made for to grind. As ready \\ntherefore must a sound understanding be for whatsoever shall happen. But he that \\nsaith, O that my children might live! and, O that all men might commend me for \\nwhatsoever I do! is an eye that seeks after green things; or as teeth, after that which \\nis tender. \\nXXXVI. There is not any man that is so happy in his death, but that some of those \\nthat are by him when he dies, will be ready to rejoice at his supposed calamity. Is it \\none that was virtuous and wise indeed? will there not some one or other be found, \\nwho thus will say to himself; “Well now at last shall I be at rest from this pedagogue. \\nHe did not indeed otherwise trouble us much: but I know well enough that in his \\nheart, he did much condemn us.” Thus will they speak of the virtuous. But as for us, \\nalas I how many things be there, for which there be many that glad would be to be \\nrid of us. This therefore if thou shalt think of whensoever thou diest, thou shalt die \\nthe more willingly, when thou shalt think with thyself; I am now to depart from that \\n                                            39 [“The poet” (34): Homer, Iliad, vi. 147.] \\n40 [“Wood”: A translation of ύλη, “matter.”]\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Safari', 'creationdate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'title': 'https:/www.maximusveritas.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations', 'author': 'Arshad Kazi', 'moddate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'source': '/content/meidtations (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 128, 'page': 94, 'page_label': '95'}, page_content=\"MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS \\nTENTH BOOK \\nMarcus Aurelius' Meditations - tr.

What then should any man desire to continue here \\nany longer? Nevertheless, whensoever thou diest, thou must not be less kind and \\nloving unto them for it; but as before, see them, continue to be their friend, to wish \\nthem well, and meekly, and gently to carry thyself towards them, but yet so that on \\nthe other side, it make thee not the more unwilling to die. But as it fareth with them \\nthat die an easy quick death, whose soul is soon separated from their bodies, so \\nmust thy separation from them be.

But begin \\nthis course with thyself first of all, and diligently examine thyself concerning whatso-\\never thou doest. \\nXXXVIII.

For it is not with her, as with dancers and players, who if they be \\ninterrupted in any part of their action, the whole action must needs be imperfect: but \\nshe in what part of time or action soever she be surprised, can make that which she \\nbath in her hand whatsoever it be, complete and full, so that she may depart with \\nthat comfort, “I have lived; neither want I anything of that which properly did belong \\nunto me.” Again, she compasseth the whole world, and penetrateth into the vanity, \\nand mere outside (wanting substance and solidity) of it, and stretcheth herself unto \\nthe infiniteness of eternity; and the revolution or restoration of all things after a cer-\\ntain period of time, to the same state and place as before, she fetcheth about, and \\ndoth comprehend in herself; and considers withal, and sees clearly this, that neither \\nthey that shall follow us, shall see any new thing, that we have not seen, nor they \\nthat went before, anything more than we: but that he that is once come to forty (if he \\nhave any wit at all) can in a manner (for that they are all of one kind) see all things, \\nboth past and future. As proper is it, and natural to the soul of man to love her \\nneighbour, to be true and modest; and to regard nothing so much as herself: which \\nis also the property of the law: whereby by the way it appears, that sound reason and \\njustice comes all to one, and therefore that justice is the chief thing, that reasonable \\ncreatures ought to propose unto themselves as their end. \\nII. A pleasant song or dance; the Pancratiast’s exercise, sports that thou art wont to \\nbe much taken with, thou shalt easily contemn; if the harmonious voice thou shalt \\ndivide into so many particular sounds whereof it doth consist, and of every one in \\nparticular shall ask thyself; whether this or that sound is it, that doth so conquer \\nthee. For thou wilt be ashamed of it. And so for shame, if accordingly thou shalt con-\\nsider it, every particular motion and posture by itself: and so for the wrestler’s exer-\\ncise too. Generally then, whatsoever it be, besides virtue, and those things that pro-\\nceed from virtue that thou art subject to be much affected with, remember presently \\nthus to divide it, and by this kind of division, in each particular to attain unto the \\ncontempt of the whole. This thou must transfer and apply to thy whole life also. \\nIII. That soul which is ever ready, even now presently (if need be) from the body, \\nwhether by way of extinction, or dispersion, or continuation in another place and es-\\ntate to be separated, how blessed and happy is it! But this readiness of it, it must \\nproceed, not from an obstinate and peremptory resolution of the mind, violently and \\npassionately set upon Opposition, as Christians are wont; but from a peculiar judg-\\nment; with discretion and gravity, so that others may be persuaded also and drawn \\nto the like example, but without any noise and passionate exclamations. \\nT\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Safari', 'creationdate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'title': 'https:/www.maximusveritas.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations', 'author': 'Arshad Kazi', 'moddate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'source': '/content/meidtations (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 128, 'page': 96, 'page_label': '97'}, page_content=\"MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS \\nELEVENTH BOOK \\nMarcus Aurelius' Meditations - tr.

See that this upon all \\noccasions may present itself unto thy mind, and never cease to think of it. What is \\nthy profession? to be good. And how should this be well brought to pass, but by cer-\\ntain theorems and doctrines; some Concerning the nature of the universe, and some \\nConcerning the proper and particular constitution of man? \\nV. Tragedies were at first brought in and instituted, to put men in mind of worldly \\nchances and casualties: that these things in the ordinary course of nature did so \\nhappen: that men that were much pleased and delighted by such accidents upon \\nthis stage, would not by the same things in a greater stage be grieved and afflicted: \\nfor here you see what is the end of all such things; and that even they that cry out so \\nmournfully to Cithaeron,42 must bear them for all their cries and exclamations, as \\nwell as others. And in very truth many good things are spoken by these poets; as \\nthat (for example) is an excellent passage: “But if so be that I and my two children be \\nneglected by the Gods, they have some reason even for that,” &c. And again, “It will \\nbut little avail thee to storm and rage against the things themselves,” &c. Again, “To \\nreap one’s life, as a ripe ear of corn”; and whatsoever else is to be found in them, that \\nis of the same kind. After the tragedy, the ancient comedy was brought in, which had \\nthe liberty to inveigh against personal vices; being therefore through this her freedom \\nand liberty of speech of very good use and effect, to restrain men from pride and ar-\\nrogancy. To which end it was, that Diogenes took also the same liberty. After these, \\nwhat were either the Middle, or New Comedy43 admitted for, but merely, (Or for the \\nmost part at least) for the delight and pleasure of curious and excellent imitation? “It \\nwill steal away; look to it,” &c. Why, no man denies, but that these also have some \\ngood things whereof that may be one: but the whole drift and foundation of that kind \\nof dramatical poetry, what is it else, but as we have said? \\nVI. How clearly doth it appear unto thee, that no other course of thy life could fit a \\ntrue philosopher’s practice better, than this very course, that thou art now already \\nin? \\nVII. A branch cut off from the continuity of that which was next unto it, must needs \\nbe cut off from the whole tree: so a man that is divided from another man, is divided \\nfrom the whole society. A branch is cut off by another, but he that hates and is \\naverse, cuts himself off from his neighbour, and knows not that at the same time he \\ndivides himself from the whole body, or corporation. But herein is the gift and mercy \\nof God, the Author of this society, in that, once cut off we may grow together and be-\\ncome part of the whole again. But if this happen often the misery is that the further a \\nman is run in this division, the harder he is to be reunited and restored again: and \\nhowever the branch which, once cut of afterwards was graffed in, gardeners can tell \\nyou is not like that which sprouted together at first, and still continued in the unity \\nof the body. \\n                                            42 [“Cithaeron” (6): Oedipus utters this cry after discovering that he has fulfilled his awful doom.

To grow together like fellow branches in matter of good correspondence and af-\\nfection; but not in matter of opinions. They that shall oppose thee in thy right cours-\\nes, as it is not in their power to divert thee from thy good action, so neither let it be \\nto divert thee from thy good affection towards them. But be it thy care to keep thyself \\nconstant in both; both in a right judgment and action, and in true meekness towards \\nthem, that either shall do their endeavour to hinder thee, or at least will be dis-\\npleased with thee for what thou hast done. For to fail in either (either in the one to \\ngive over for fear, or in the other to forsake thy natural affection towards him, who by \\nnature is both thy friend and thy kinsman) is equally base, and much savouring of \\nthe disposition of a cowardly fugitive soldier. \\nIX. It is not possible that any nature should be inferior unto art, since that all arts \\nimitate nature. If this be so; that the most perfect and general nature of all natures \\nshould in her operation come short of the skill of arts, is most improbable. Now \\ncommon is it to all arts, to make that which is worse for the better’s sake. Much \\nmore then doth the common nature do the same. Hence is the first ground of justice. \\nFrom justice all other virtues have their existence. For justice cannot be preserved, if \\neither we settle our minds and affections upon worldly things; or be apt to be de-\\nceived, or rash, and inconstant. \\nX. The things themselves (which either to get or to avoid thou art put to so much \\ntrouble) come not unto thee themselves; but thou in a manner goest unto them. Let \\nthen thine own judgment and opinion concerning those things be at rest; and as for \\nthe things themselves, they stand still and quiet, without any noise or stir at all; and \\nso shall all pursuing and flying cease. \\nXI. Then is the soul as Empedocles doth liken it, like unto a sphere or globe, when \\nshe is all of one form and figure: when she neither greedily stretcheth out herself un-\\nto anything, nor basely contracts herself, or lies flat and dejected; but shineth all \\nwith light, whereby she does see and behold the true nature, both that of the uni-\\nverse, and her own in particular. \\nXII. Will any contemn me? let him look to that, upon what grounds he does it: my \\ncare shall be that I may never be found either doing or speaking anything that doth \\ntruly deserve contempt. Will any hate me? let him look to that. I for my part will be \\nkind and loving unto all, and even unto him that hates me, whomsoever he be, will I \\nbe ready to show his error, not by way of exprobation or ostentation of my patience, \\nbut ingenuously and meekly: such as was that famous Phocion,44 if so be that he did \\nnot dissemble. For it is inwardly that these things must be: that the Gods who look \\ninwardly, and not upon the outward appearance, may behold a man truly free from \\nall indignation and grief. For what hurt can it be unto thee whatsoever any man else \\ndoth, as long as thou mayest do that which is proper and suitable to thine own na-\\nture? Wilt not thou (a man wholly appointed to be both what, and as the common \\ngood shall require) accept of that which is now seasonable to the nature of the uni-\\nverse? \\n                                            44 [“Phocion” (13): When about to be put to death he charged his son to bear no malice against the Athenians.]\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Safari', 'creationdate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'title': 'https:/www.maximusveritas.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations', 'author': 'Arshad Kazi', 'moddate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'source': '/content/meidtations (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 128, 'page': 98, 'page_label': '99'}, page_content=\"MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS \\nELEVENTH BOOK \\nMarcus Aurelius' Meditations - tr.

They contemn one another, and yet they seek to please one another: and whilest \\nthey seek to surpass one another in worldly pomp and greatness, they most debase \\nand prostitute themselves in their better part one to another. \\nXIV. How rotten and insincere is he, that saith, I am resolved to carry myself hereaf-\\nter towards you with all ingenuity and simplicity. O man, what doest thou mean! \\nwhat needs this profession of thine? the thing itself will show it. It ought to be writ-\\nten upon thy forehead. No sooner thy voice is heard, than thy countenance must be \\nable to show what is in thy mind: even as he that is loved knows presently by the \\nlooks of his sweetheart what is in her mind. Such must he be for all the world, that \\nis truly simple and good, as he whose arm-holes are offensive, that whosoever stands \\nby, as soon as ever he comes near him, may as it were smell him whether he will or \\nno. But the affectation of simplicity is nowise laudable. There is nothing more \\nshameful than perfidious friendship. Above all things, that must be avoided. However \\ntrue goodness, simplicity, and kindness cannot so be hidden, but that as we have \\nalready said in the very eyes and countenance they will show themselves. \\nXV. To live happily is an inward power of the soul, when she is affected with indiffer-\\nency, towards those things that are by their nature indifferent. To be thus affected \\nshe must consider all worldly objects both divided and whole: remembering withal \\nthat no object can of itself beget any opinion in us, neither can come to us, but \\nstands without still and quiet; but that we ourselves beget, and as it were print in \\nourselves opinions concerning them. Now it is in our power, not to print them; and if \\nthey creep in and lurk in some corner, it is in our power to wipe them off. Remember-\\ning moreover, that this care and circumspection of thine, is to continue but for a \\nwhile, and then thy life will be at an end. And what should hinder, but that thou \\nmayest do well with all these things? For if they be according to nature, rejoice in \\nthem, and let them be pleasing and acceptable unto thee. But if they be against na-\\nture, seek thou that which is according to thine own nature, and whether it be for \\nthy credit or no, use all possible speed for the attainment of it: for no man ought to \\nbe blamed, for seeking his own good and happiness. \\nXVI. Of everything thou must consider from whence it came, of what things it doth \\nconsist, and into what it will be changed: what will be the nature of it, or what it will \\nbe like unto when it is changed; and that it can suffer no hurt by this change. And as \\nfor other men’s either foolishness or wickedness, that it may not trouble and grieve \\nthee; first generally thus; What reference have I unto these? and that we are all born \\nfor one another’s good: then more particularly after another consideration; as a ram \\nis first in a flock of sheep, and a bull in a herd of cattle, so am I born to rule over \\nthem. Begin yet higher, even from this: if atoms be not the beginning of all things, \\nthan which to believe nothing can be more absurd, then must we needs grant that \\nthere is a nature, that doth govern the universe. If such a nature, then are all worse \\nthings made for the better’s sake; and all better for one another’s sake. Secondly, \\nwhat manner of men they be, at board, and upon their beds, and so forth. But above \\nall things, how they are forced by their opinions that they hold, to do what they do; \\nand even those things that they do, with what pride and self-conceit they do them. \\nThirdly, that if they do these things rightly, thou hast no reason to be grieved.

For as, according to Plato’s opinion, no soul doth willingly err, so by con-\\nsequent neither doth it anything otherwise than it ought, but against her will. There-\\nfore are they grieved, whensoever they hear themselves charged, either of injustice, \\nor unconscionableness, or covetousness, or in general, of any injurious kind of deal-\\ning towards their neighbours. Fourthly, that thou thyself doest transgress in many \\nthings, and art even such another as they are. And though perchance thou doest \\nforbear the very act of some sins, yet hast thou in thyself an habitual disposition to \\nthem, but that either through fear, or vainglory, or some such other ambitious fool-\\nish respect, thou art restrained. Fifthly, that whether they have sinned or no, thou \\ndoest not understand perfectly. For many things are done by way of discreet policy; \\nand generally a man must know many things first, before he be able truly and judi-\\nciously to judge of another man’s action. Sixthly, that whensoever thou doest take on \\ngrievously, or makest great woe, little doest thou remember then that a man’s life is \\nbut for a moment of time, and that within a while we shall all be in our graves. Sev-\\nenthly, that it is not the sins and transgressions themselves that trouble us properly; \\nfor they have their existence in their minds and understandings only, that commit \\nthem; but our own opinions concerning those sins. Remove then, and be content to \\npart with that conceit of thine, that it is a grievous thing, and thou hast removed \\nthine anger. But how should I remove it? How? reasoning with thyself that it is not \\nshameful. For if that which is shameful, be not the only true evil that is, thou also \\nwilt be driven whilest thou doest follow the common instinct of nature, to avoid that \\nwhich is evil, to commit many unjust things, and to become a thief, and anything, \\nthat will make to the attainment of thy intended worldly ends. Eighthly, how many \\nthings may and do oftentimes follow upon such fits of anger and grief; far more \\ngrievous in themselves, than those very things which we are so grieved or angry for. \\nNinthly, that meekness is a thing unconquerable, if it be true and natural, and not \\naffected or hypocritical. For how shall even the most fierce and malicious that thou \\nshalt conceive, be able to hold on against thee, if thou shalt still continue meek and \\nloving unto him; and that even at that time, when he is about to do thee wrong, thou \\nshalt be well disposed, and in good temper, with all meekness to teach him, and to \\ninstruct him better? As for example; My son, we were not born for this, to hurt and \\nannoy one another; it will be thy hurt not mine, my son: and so to show him forcibly \\nand fully, that it is so in very deed: and that neither bees do it one to another, nor \\nany other creatures that are naturally sociable. But this thou must do, not scoffingly, \\nnot by way of exprobation, but tenderly without any harshness of words. Neither \\nmust thou do it by way of exercise, or ostentation, that they that are by and hear \\nthee, may admire thee: but so always that nobody be privy to it, but himself alone: \\nyea, though there be more present at the same time. These nine particular heads, as \\nso many gifts from the Muses, see that thou remember well: and begin one day, \\nwhilest thou art yet alive, to be a man indeed. But on the other side thou must take \\nheed, as much to flatter them, as to be angry with them: for both are equally unchar-\\nitable, and equally hurtful. And in thy passions, take it presently to thy considera-\\ntion, that to be angry is not the part of a man, but that to be meek and gentle, as it \\nsavours of more humanity, so of more manhood. That in this, there is strength and \\nnerves, or vigour and fortitude: whereof anger and indignation is altogether void. For \\nthe nearer everything is unto unpassionateness, the nearer it is unto power. And as\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Safari', 'creationdate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'title': 'https:/www.maximusveritas.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations', 'author': 'Arshad Kazi', 'moddate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'source': '/content/meidtations (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 128, 'page': 100, 'page_label': '101'}, page_content=\"MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS \\nELEVENTH BOOK \\nMarcus Aurelius' Meditations - tr.

For both, both he that is angry and \\nthat grieveth, have received a wound, and cowardly have as it were yielded them-\\nselves unto their affections. If thou wilt have a tenth also, receive this tenth gift from \\nHercules the guide and leader of the Muses: that is a mad man’s part, to look that \\nthere should be no wicked men in the world, because it is impossible. Now for a man \\nto brook well enough, that there should be wicked men in the world, but not to en-\\ndure that any should transgress against himself, is against all equity, and indeed ty-\\nrannical. \\nXVII. Four several dispositions or inclinations there be of the mind and understand-\\ning, which to be aware of, thou must carefully observe: and whensoever thou doest \\ndiscover them, thou must rectify them, saying to thyself concerning every one of \\nthem, This imagination is not necessary; this is uncharitable: this thou shalt speak \\nas another man’s slave, or instrument; than which nothing can be more senseless \\nand absurd: for the fourth, thou shalt sharply check and upbraid thyself; for that \\nthou doest suffer that more divine part in thee, to become subject and obnoxious to \\nthat more ignoble part of thy body, and the gross lusts and concupiscences thereof. \\nXVIII. What portion soever, either of air or fire there be in thee, although by nature it \\ntend upwards, submitting nevertheless to the ordinance of the universe, it abides \\nhere below in this mixed body. So whatsoever is in thee, either earthy, or humid, alt-\\nhough by nature it tend downwards, yet is it against its nature both raised upwards, \\nand standing, or consistent. So obedient are even the elements themselves to the \\nuniverse, abiding patiently wheresoever (though against their nature) they are \\nplaced, until the sound as it were of their retreat, and separation. Is it not a grievous \\nthing then, that thy reasonable part only should be disobedient, and should not en-\\ndure to keep its place: yea though it be nothing enjoined that is contrary unto it, but \\nthat only which is according to its nature? For we cannot say of it when it is disobe-\\ndient, as we say of the fire, or air, that it tends upwards towards its proper element, \\nfor then goes it the quite contrary way. For the motion of the mind to any injustice, \\nor incontinency, or to sorrow, or to fear, is nothing else but a separation from nature. \\nAlso when the mind is grieved for anything that is happened by the divine provi-\\ndence, then doth it likewise forsake its own place. For it was ordained unto holiness \\nand godliness, which specially consist in an humble submission to God and His \\nprovidence in all things; as well as unto justice: these also being part of those duties, \\nwhich as naturally sociable, we are bound unto; and without which we cannot happi-\\nly converse one with another: yea and the very ground and fountain indeed of all just \\nactions. \\nXIX. He that hath not one and the self-same general end always as long as he liveth, \\ncannot possibly be one and the self-same man always. But this will not suffice except \\nthou add also what ought to be this general end. For as the general conceit and ap-\\nprehension of all those things which upon no certain ground are by the greater part \\nof men deemed good, cannot be uniform and agreeable, but that only which is lim-\\nited and restrained by some certain proprieties and conditions, as of community: \\nthat nothing be conceived good, which is not commonly and publicly good: so must \\nthe end also that we propose unto ourselves, be common and sociable.

Remember the fable of the country mouse and the city mouse, and the great \\nfright and terror that this was put into. \\nXXI. Socrates was wont to call the common conceits and opinions of men, the com-\\nmon bugbears of the world: the proper terror of silly children. \\nXXII. The Lacedæmonians at their public spectacles were wont to appoint seats and \\nforms for their strangers in the shadow, they themselves were content to sit any-\\nwhere. \\nXXIII. What Socrates answered unto Perdiccas, why he did not come unto him, Lest \\nof all deaths I should die the worst kind of death, said he: that is, not able to requite \\nthe good that hath been done unto me. \\nXXIV. In the ancient mystical letters of the Ephesians, there was an item, that a man \\nshould always have in his mind some one or other of the ancient worthies. \\nXXV. The Pythagoreans were wont betimes in the morning the first thing they did, to \\nlook up unto the heavens, to put themselves in mind of them who constantly and in-\\nvariably did perform their task: as also to put themselves in mind of orderliness, or \\ngood order, and of purity, and of naked simplicity. For no star or planet hath any \\ncover before it. \\nXXVI.

To holiness, in accepting \\nwillingly whatsoever is sent by the Divine Providence, as being that which the nature \\nof the universe hath appointed unto thee, which also hath appointed thee for that, \\nwhatsoever it be. To righteousness, in speaking the truth freely, and without ambigu-\\nity; and in doing all things justly and discreetly.

I have often wondered how it should come to pass, that every man loving himself \\nbest, should more regard other men’s opinions concerning himself than his own. For \\nif any God or grave master standing by, should command any of us to think nothing \\nby himself but what he should presently speak out; no man were able to endure it, \\nthough but for one day. Thus do we fear more what our neighbours will think of us, \\nthan what we ourselves. \\nIV. How come it to pass that the Gods having ordered all other things so well and so \\nlovingly, should be overseen in this one only thing, that whereas then. hath been \\nsome very good men that have made many covenants as it were with God and by \\nmany holy actions and outward services contracted a kind of familiarity with Him; \\nthat these men when once they are dead, should never be restored to life, but be ex-\\ntinct for ever. But this thou mayest be sure of, that this (if it be so indeed) would \\nnever have been so ordered by the Gods, had it been fit otherwise. For certainly it \\nwas possible, had it been more just so and had it been according to nature, the na-\\nture of the universe would easily have borne it. But now because it is not so, (if so be \\nthat it be not so indeed) be therefore confident that it was not fit it should be so. for \\nthou seest thyself, that now seeking after this matter, how freely thou doest argue \\nand contest with God. But were not the Gods both just and good in the highest de-\\ngree, thou durst not thus reason with them. Now if just and good, it could not be \\nthat in the creation of the world, they should either unjustly or unreasonably oversee \\nanything. \\nV. Use thyself even unto those things that thou doest at first despair of. For the left \\nhand we see, which for the most part lieth idle because not used; yet doth it hold the \\nbridle with more strength than the right, because it hath been used unto it. \\nVI. Let these be the objects of thy ordinary meditation: to consider, what manner of \\nmen both for soul and body we ought to be, whensoever death shall surprise us: the \\nshortness of this our mortal life: the immense vastness of the time that hath been \\nbefore, and will he after us: the frailty of every worldly material object: all these \\nthings to consider, and behold clearly in themselves, all disguisement of external \\noutside being removed and taken away. Again, to consider the efficient causes of all \\nthings: the proper ends and references of all actions: what pain is in itself; what \\npleasure, what death: what fame or honour, how every man is the true and proper \\nground of his own rest and tranquillity, and that no man can truly be hindered by \\nany other: that all is but conceit and opinion. As for the use of thy dogmata, thou \\nmust carry thyself in the practice of them, rather like unto a pancratiastes, or one \\nthat at the same time both fights and wrestles with hands and feet, than a gladiator. \\nFor this, if he lose his sword that he fights with, he is gone: whereas the other hath \\nstill his hand free, which he may easily turn and manage at his will. \\nVII. All worldly things thou must behold and consider, dividing them into matter, \\nform, and reference, or their proper end. \\nVIII.

Whatsoever doth happen in the ordinary course and consequence of natural \\nevents, neither the Gods, (for it is not possible, that they either wittingly or unwit-\\ntingly should do anything amiss) nor men, (for it is through ignorance, and therefore \\nagainst their wills that they do anything amiss) must he accused.

Either fate, (and that either an absolute necessity, and unavoidable decree; or a \\nplacable and flexible Providence) or all is a mere casual confusion, void of all order \\nand government. If an absolute and unavoidable necessity, why doest thou resist? If \\na placable and exorable Providence, make thyself worthy of the divine help and assis-\\ntance. If all be a mere confusion without any moderator, or governor, then hast thou \\nreason to congratulate thyself; that in such a general flood of confusion thou thyself \\nhast obtained a reasonable faculty, whereby thou mayest govern thine own life and \\nactions. But if thou beest carried away with the flood, it must be thy body perchance, \\nor thy life, or some other thing that belongs unto them that is carried away: thy mind \\nand understanding cannot. Or should it be so, that the light of a candle indeed is \\nstill bright and lightsome until it be put out: and should truth, and righteousness, \\nand temperance cease to shine in thee whilest thou thyself hast any being? \\nXII. At the conceit and apprehension that such and such a one hath sinned, thus \\nreason with thyself; What do I know whether this be a sin indeed, as it seems to be? \\nBut if it be, what do I know but that he himself hath already condemned himself for \\nit? And that is all one as if a man should scratch and tear his own face, an object of \\ncompassion rather than of anger. Again, that he that would not have a vicious man \\nto sin, is like unto him that would not have moisture in the fig, nor children to weep \\nnor a horse to neigh, nor anything else that in the course of nature is necessary. For \\nwhat shall he do that hath such an habit? If thou therefore beest powerful and elo-\\nquent, remedy it if thou canst. \\nXIII. If it be not fitting, do it not. If it be not true, speak it not. Ever maintain thine \\nown purpose and resolution free from all compulsion and necessity. \\nXIV. Of everything that presents itself unto thee, to consider what the true nature of \\nit is, and to unfold it, as it were, by dividing it into that which is formal: that which is \\nmaterial: the true use or end of it, and the just time that it is appointed to last. \\nXV. It is high time for thee, to understand that there is somewhat in thee, better and \\nmore divine than either thy passions, or thy sensual appetites and affections. What \\nis now the object of my mind, is it fear, or suspicion, or lust, or any such thing? To \\ndo nothing rashly without some certain end; let that be thy first care. The next, to \\nhave no other end than the common good. For, alas! yet a little while, and thou art \\nno more: no more will any, either of those things that now thou seest, or of those \\nmen that now are living, be any more. For all things are by nature appointed soon to \\nbe changed, turned, and corrupted, that other things might succeed in their room. \\nXVI.

No operation whatsoever it he, ceasing for a while, can be truly said to suffer \\nany evil, because it is at an end. Neither can he that is the author of that operation; \\nfor this very respect, because his operation is at an end, be said to suffer any evil. \\nLikewise then, neither can the whole body of all our actions (which is our life) if in \\ntime it cease, be said to suffer any evil for this very reason, because it is at an end; \\nnor he truly be said to have been ill affected, that did put a period to this series of \\nactions. Now this time or certain period, depends of the determination of nature: \\nsometimes of particular nature, as when a man dieth old; but of nature in general, \\nhowever; the parts whereof thus changing one after another, the whole world still \\ncontinues fresh and new. Now that is ever best and most seasonable, which is for the \\ngood of the whole. Thus it appears that death of itself can neither be hurtful to any in \\nparticular, because it is not a shameful thing (for neither is it a thing that depends of \\nour own will, nor of itself contrary to the common good) and generally, as it is both \\nexpedient and seasonable to the whole, that in that respect it must needs be good. It \\nis that also, which is brought unto us by the order and appointment of the Divine \\nProvidence; so that he whose will and mind in these things runs along with the Di-\\nvine ordinance, and by this concurrence of his will and mind with the Divine Provi-\\ndence, is led and driven along, as it were by God Himself; may truly be termed and \\nesteemed the θεοφόρητος, or divinely led and inspired. \\nXVIII. These three things thou must have always in a readiness: first concerning \\nthine own actions, whether thou doest nothing either idly, or otherwise, than justice \\nand equity do require: and concerning those things that happen unto thee externally, \\nthat either they happen unto thee by chance, or by providence; of which two to ac-\\ncuse either, is equally against reason. Secondly, what like unto our bodies are \\nwhilest yet rude and imperfect, until they be animated: and from their animation, \\nuntil their expiration: of what things they are compounded, and into what things \\nthey shall be dissolved. Thirdly, how vain all things will appear unto thee when, from \\non high as it were, looking down thou shalt contemplate all things upon earth, and \\nthe wonderful mutability, that they are subject unto: considering withal, the infinite \\nboth greatness and variety of things aerial and things celestial that are round about \\nit. And that as often as thou shalt behold them, thou shalt still see the same: as the \\nsame things, so the same shortness of continuance of all those things. And, behold, \\nthese be the things that we are so proud and puffed up for. \\nXIX. Cast away from thee opinion, and thou art safe. And what is it that hinders thee \\nfrom casting of it away? When thou art grieved at anything, hast thou forgotten that \\nall things happen according to the nature of the universe; and that him only it con-\\ncerns, who is in fault; and moreover, that what is now done, is that which from ever \\nhath been done in the world, and will ever be done, and is now done everywhere: how \\nnearly all men are allied one to another by a kindred not of blood, nor of seed, but of \\nthe same mind. Thou hast also forgotten that every man’s mind partakes of the Dei-\\nty, and issueth from thence; and that no man can properly call anything his own, no \\nnot his son, nor his body, nor his life; for that they all proceed from that One who is \\nthe giver of all things: that all things are but opinion; that no man lives properly, but\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Safari', 'creationdate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'title': 'https:/www.maximusveritas.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations', 'author': 'Arshad Kazi', 'moddate': \"D:20240110035838Z00'00'\", 'source': '/content/meidtations (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 128, 'page': 107, 'page_label': '108'}, page_content=\"MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS \\nTWELFTH BOOK \\nMarcus Aurelius' Meditations - tr.

And therefore that no man whensoev-\\ner he dieth can properly be said to lose any more, than an instant of time. \\nXX. Let thy thoughts ever run upon them, who once for some one thing or other, \\nwere moved with extraordinary indignation; who were once in the highest pitch of \\neither honour, or calamity; or mutual hatred and enmity; or of any other fortune or \\ncondition whatsoever. Then consider what’s now become of all those things. All is \\nturned to smoke; all to ashes, and a mere fable; and perchance not so much as a fa-\\nble. As also whatsoever is of this nature, as Fabius Catulinus in the field; Lucius Lu-\\npus, and Stertinius, at Baiæ; Tiberius at Capreæ: and Velius Rufus, and all such ex-\\namples of vehement prosecution in worldly matters; let these also run in thy mind at \\nthe same time; and how vile every object of such earnest and vehement prosecution \\nis; and how much more agreeable to true philosophy it is, for a man to carry himself \\nin every matter that offers itself; justly, and moderately, as one that followeth the \\nGods with all simplicity. For, for a man to be proud and high conceited, that he is \\nnot proud and high conceited, is of all kind of pride and presumption, the most intol-\\nerable. \\nXXI. To them that ask thee, Where hast thou seen the Gods, or how knowest thou \\ncertainly that there be Gods, that thou art so devout in their worship? I answer first \\nof all, that even to the very eye, they are in some manner visible and apparent. Sec-\\nondly, neither have I ever seen mine own soul, and yet I respect and honour it. So \\nthen for the Gods, by the daily experience that I have of their power and providence \\ntowards myself and others, I know certainly that they are, and therefore worship \\nthem. \\nXXII. Herein doth consist happiness of life, for a man to know thoroughly the true \\nnature of everything; what is the matter, and what is the form of it: with all his heart \\nand soul, ever to do that which is just, and to speak the truth. What then remaineth \\nbut to enjoy thy life in a course and coherence of good actions, one upon another \\nimmediately succeeding, and never interrupted, though for never so little a while? \\nXXIII. There is but one light of the sun, though it be intercepted by walls and moun-\\ntains, and other thousand objects. There is but one common substance of the whole \\nworld, though it be concluded and restrained into several different bodies, in number \\ninfinite. There is but one common soul, though divided into innumerable particular \\nessences and natures. So is there but one common intellectual soul, though it seem \\nto be divided. And as for all other parts of those generals which we have mentioned, \\nas either sensitive souls or subjects, these of themselves (as naturally irrational) have \\nno common mutual reference one unto another, though many of them contain a \\nmind, or reasonable faculty in them, whereby they are ruled and governed. But of \\nevery reasonable mind, this the particular nature, that it hath reference to whatsoev-\\ner is of her own kind, and desireth to be united: neither can this common affection, \\nor mutual unity and correspondency, be here intercepted or divided, or confined to \\nparticulars as those other common things are. \\nXXIV. What doest thou desire? To live long. What? To enjoy the operations of a sensi-\\ntive soul; or of the appetitive faculty? or wouldst thou grow, and then decrease \\nagain?

But for a man to grieve that by death he shall be \\ndeprived of any of these things, is both against God and reason. \\nXXV. What a small portion of vast and infinite eternity it is, that is allowed unto eve-\\nry one of us, and how soon it vanisheth into the general age of the world: of the \\ncommon substance, and of the common soul also what a small portion is allotted un-\\nto us: and in what a little clod of the whole earth (as it were) it is that thou doest \\ncrawl. After thou shalt rightly have considered these things with thyself; fancy not \\nanything else in the world any more to be of any weight and moment but this, to do \\nthat only which thine own nature doth require; and to conform thyself to that which \\nthe common nature doth afford. \\nXXVI. What is the present estate of my understanding? For herein lieth all indeed. As \\nfor all other things, they are without the compass of mine own will: and if without the \\ncompass of my will, then are they as dead things unto me, and as it were mere \\nsmoke. \\nXXVII. To stir up a man to the contempt of death this among other things, is of good \\npower and efficacy, that even they who esteemed pleasure to be happiness, and pain \\nmisery, did nevertheless many of them contemn death as much as any. And can \\ndeath be terrible to him, to whom that only seems good, which in the ordinary course \\nof nature is seasonable? to him, to whom, whether his actions be many or few, so \\nthey be all good, is all one; and who whether he behold the things of the world being \\nalways the same either for many years, or for few years only, is altogether indiffer-\\nent? O man! as a citizen thou hast lived, and conversed in this great city the world. \\nWhether just for so many years, or no, what is it unto thee? Thou hast lived (thou \\nmayest be sure) as long as the laws and orders of the city required; which may be the \\ncommon comfort of all. Why then should it be grievous unto thee, if (not a tyrant, nor \\nan unjust judge, but) the same nature that brought thee in, doth now send thee out \\nof the world? As if the praetor should fairly dismiss him from the stage, whom he had \\ntaken in to act a while. Oh, but the play is not yet at an end, there are but three acts \\nyet acted of it? Thou hast well said: for in matter of life, three acts is the whole play. \\nNow to set a certain time to every man’s acting, belongs unto him only, who as first \\nhe was of thy composition, so is now the cause of thy dissolution. As for thyself; thou \\nhast to do with neither.

By the exercise of his profession he became wealthy; and if he speaks of \\nhis means as not great,49 he must be comparing his wealth with the grandees of \\nRome, not with the ordinary citizen. \\nBefore the present century nothing was known of the works of Fronto, except a \\ngrammatical treatise; but in 1815 Cardinal Mai published a number of letters and \\nsome short essays of Fronto, which he had discovered in a palimpsest at Milan. Oth-\\ner parts of the same MS. he found later in the Vatican, the whole being collected and \\nedited in the year 1823. We now possess parts of his correspondence with Antoninus \\nPius, with M. Aurelius, with L. Verus, and with certain of his friends, and also sever-\\nal rhetorical and historical fragments. Though none of the more ambitious works of \\nFronto have survived, there are enough to give proof of his powers. Never was a great \\nliterary reputation less deserved. It would be bard to conceive of anything more vapid \\nthan the style and conception of these letters; clearly the man was a pedant without \\nimagination or taste. Such indeed was the age he lived in, and it is no marvel that he \\nwas like to his age. But there must have been more in him than mere pedantry; there \\nwas indeed a heart in the man, which Marcus found, arid he found also a tongue \\nwhich could speak the truth. Fronto’s letters are by no means free from exaggeration \\nand laudation, but they do not show that loathsome flattery which filled the Roman \\ncourt. He really admires what he praises, and his way of saying so is not unlike what \\noften passes for criticism at the present day. He is not afraid to reprove what he \\nthinks amiss; and the astonishment of Marcus at this will prove, if proof were need-\\ned, that he was not used to plain dealing. “How happy I am,” he writes, “that my \\nfriend Marcus Cornelius, so distinguished as an orator and so noble as a man, \\nthinks me worth praising and blaming.”50 In another place he deems himself blest \\nbecause Pronto had taught him to speak the truth;51 although the context shows \\nhim to be speaking of expression, it is still a point in favour of Pronto. A sincere heart \\nis better than literary taste; and if Fronto had not done his duty by the young prince, \\n                                            48 References are made to the edition of Naber, Leipzig (Trübner), 1867. \\n49 Ad Verum Imp.

Herodes was a Greek rhetorician who had a \\nschool at Rome, and Marcus Aurelius was among his pupils. Both Marcus and the \\nEmperor Antoninus had a high opinion of Herodes; and all we know goes to prove he \\nwas a man of high character and princely generosity. When quite young he was made \\nadministrator of the free cities in Asia, nor is it surprising to find that he made bitter \\nenemies there; indeed, a just ruler was sure to make enemies. The end of it was that \\nan Athenian deputation, headed by the orators Theodotus and Demostratus, made \\nserious accusations against his honour. There is no need to discuss the merits of the \\ncase here; suffice it to say, Herodes succeeded in defending himself to the satisfac-\\ntion of the emperor. Pronto appears to have taken the delegates’ part, and to have \\naccepted a brief for the prosecution, urged to some extent by personal considera-\\ntions; and in this cause Marcus Aurelius writes to Fronto as follows: \\n“AURELIUS CÆSAR to his friend FRONTO, greeting.52 \\n“I know you have often told me you were anxious to find how you might best \\nplease me. Now is the time; now you can increase my love towards you, if it can \\nbe increased. A trial is at hand, in which people seem likely not only to hear \\nyour speech with pleasure, but to see your indignation with impatience. I see \\nno one who dares give you a hint in the matter; for those who are less friendly, \\nprefer to see you act with some inconsistency; and those who are more friendly, \\nfear to seem too friendly to your opponent if they should dissuade you from \\nyour accusation; then again, in case you have prepared something neat for the \\noccasion, they cannot endure to rob you of your harangue by silencing you. \\nTherefore, whether you think me a rash counsellor, or a bold boy, or too kind to \\nyour opponent, not because I think it better, I will offer my counsel with some \\ncaution. But why have I said, offer my counsel? No, I demand it from you; I \\ndemand it boldly, and if I succeed, I promise to remain under your obligation. \\nWhat? you will say if I am attackt, shall I not pay tit for tat? Ah, but you will get \\ngreater glory, if even when attackt you answer nothing. Indeed, if he begins it, \\nanswer as you will and you will have fair excuse; but I have demanded of him \\nthat he shall not begin, and I think I have succeeded. I love each of you accord-\\ning to your merits and I know that lie was educated in the house of P. Calvisi-\\nus, my grandfather, and that I was educated by you; therefore I am full of anxi-\\nety that this most disagreeable business shall be managed as honourably as \\npossible. I trust you may approve my advice, for my intention you will approve. \\nAt least I prefer to write unwisely rather than to be silent unkindly.” \\nFronto replied, thanking the prince for his advice, and promising that he will confine \\nhimself to the facts of the case. But he points out that the charges brought against \\nHerodes were such, that they can hardly be made agreeable; amongst them being \\n                                            52 Ad M.

However, he is willing even to let some of these \\ndrop if it be the prince’s pleasure. To this Marcus returned the following answer:53 \\n“This one thing, my dearest Fronto, is enough to make me truly grateful to you, \\nthat so far from rejecting my counsel, you have even approved it. As to the \\nquestion you raise in your kind letter, my opinion is this: all that concerns the \\ncase which you are supporting must be clearly brought forward; what concerns \\nyour own feelings, though you may have had just provocation, should be left \\nunsaid.” \\nThe story does credit to both. Fronto shows no loss of temper at the interference, nor \\nshrinks from stating his case with frankness; and Marcus, with forbearance remark-\\nable in a prince, does not command that his friend be left unmolested, but merely \\nstipulates for a fair trial on the merits of the case. \\nAnother example may he given from a letter of Fronto’s:54 \\n“Here is something else quarrelsome and querulous. I have sometimes found \\nfault with you in your absence somewhat seriously in the company of a few of \\nmy most intimate friends: at times, for example, when you mixt in society with \\na more solemn look than was fitting, or would read books in the theatre or in a \\nbanquet; nor did I absent myself from theatre or banquet when you did.55 Then \\nI used to call you a hard man, no good company, even disagreeable, sometimes, \\nwhen anger got the better of me. But did any one else in the same banquet \\nspeak against you, I could not endure to hear it with equanimity. Thus it was \\neasier for me to say something to your disadvantage myself, than to hear others \\ndo it; just as I could more easily bear to chastise my daughter Gratia, than to \\nsee her chastised by another.” \\nThe affection between them is clear from every page of the correspondence. A few in-\\nstances are now given, which were written at different periods: \\nTO MY MASTER.56 \\n“This is how I have past the last few days. My sister was suddenly seized with \\nan internal pain, so violent that I was horrified at her looks; my mother in her \\ntrepidation on that account accidentally bruised her side on a corner of the \\nwall; she and we were greatly troubled about that blow. For myself; on going to \\nrest I found a scorpion in my bed; but I did not lie down upon him, I killed him \\nfirst. If you are getting on better, that is a consolation. My mother is easier now, \\nthanks be to God. Good-bye, best and sweetest master.

Well, you shall love me more \\nthan any man loves any other man; but I, who possess a faculty of loving less \\nstrong, shall love you more than any one else loves you; more indeed than you \\nlove yourself. Gratia and I will have to fight for it; I doubt I shall not get the bet-\\nter of her. For, as Plautus says, her love is like rain, whose big drops not only \\npenetrate the dress, but drench to the very marrow.” \\nMarcus Aurelius seems to have been about eighteen years of age when the corre-\\nspondence begins, Fronto being some thirty years older.63 The systematic education \\nof the young prince seems to have been finisht, and Pronto now acts more as his ad-\\nviser than his tutor. He recommends the prince to use simplicity in his public \\nspeeches, and to avoid affectation.64 Marcus devotes his attention to the old authors \\nwho then had a great vogue at Rome: Ennius, Plautus, Nævius, and such orators as \\n                                            58 [Ibid.] iii. 21. \\n59 [Ibid.] ii. 2. \\n60 The writer sometimes uses archaisms such as quom, which I render ‘whenas.’ \\n61 [Ibid.] ii. 2. \\n62 The writer parodies the proclamation at the Greek games; the words also are Greek. \\n63 From internal evidence: the letters are not arranged in order of time.

Marcus gives his nights to reading when he ought to be sleeping. \\nHe exercises himself in verse composition and on rhetorical themes. \\n“It is very nice of you,” he writes to Fronto,66 “to ask for my hexameters; I would \\nhave sent them at once if I had them by me. The fact is my secretary, Anicetus \\n— you know who I mean — did not pack up any of my compositions for me to \\ntake away with me. He knows my weakness; he was afraid that if I got hold of \\nthem I might, as usual, make smoke of them. However, there was no fear for \\nthe hexameters. I must confess the truth to my master: I love them. I study at \\nnight, since the day is taken up with the theatre. I am weary of an evening, and \\nsleepy in the daylight, and so I don’t do much. Yet I have made extracts from \\nsixty books, five volumes of them, in these latter days. But when you read re-\\nmember that the “sixty” includes plays of Novius, and farces, and some little \\nspeeches of Scipio; don’t be too much startled at the number. You remember \\nyour Polemon; but I pray you do not remember Horace, who has died with Pol-\\nlio as far as I am concerned.67 Farewell, my dearest and most affectionate \\nfriend, most distinguished consul and my beloved master, whom I have not \\nseen these two years. Those who say two months, count the days. Shall I ever \\nsee you again?” \\nSometimes Fronto sends him a theme to work up, as thus: “M. Lucilius tribune of \\nthe people violently throws into prison a free Roman citizen, against the opinion of \\nhis colleagues who demand his release. For this act he is branded by the censor. An-\\nalyse the case, and then take both sides in turn, attacking and defending.”68 Or \\nagain: “A Roman consul, doffing his state robe, dons the gauntlet and kills a lion \\namongst the young men at the Quinquatrus in full view of the people of Rome. De-\\nnunciation before the censors.”69 The prince has a fair knowledge of Greek, and \\nquotes from Homer, Plato, Euripides, but for some reason Fronto dissuaded him \\nfrom this study.70 His Meditations are written in Greek. He continued his literary \\nstudies throughout his life, and after he became emperor we still find him asking his \\nadviser for copies of Cicero’s Letters, by which he hopes to improve his vocabulary.71 \\nPronto Helps him with a supply of similes, which, it seems, he did not think of readi-\\nly. It is to be feared that the fount of Marcus’s eloquence was pumped up by artificial \\nmeans. \\n                                            65 [Ibid.] ii. 10, iii. 18, ii. 4. \\n66 [Ibid.] ii. 10. \\n67 He implies, as in i. 6, that he has ceased to study Horace.

If \\nyou ask what I thought of him, listen. He seems to me an industrious farmer, \\nendowed with the greatest skill, who has cultivated a large estate for corn and \\nvines only, and indeed with a rich return of fine crops. But yet in that land of \\nhis there is no Pompeian fig or Arician vegetable, no Tarentine rose, or pleasing \\ncoppice, or thick grove, or shady plane tree; all is for use rather than for pleas-\\nure, such as one ought rather to commend, but cares not to love. \\n“A pretty bold idea, is it not, and rash judgment, to pass censure on a man of \\nsuch reputation? But whenas I remember that I am writing to you, I think I am \\nless bold than you would have me. \\n“In that point I am wholly undecided. \\n“There’s an unpremeditated hendecasyllable for you.

And this does not come of your fine style and eloquence: otherwise \\nnot my mother only, but all who breathe.” \\nTo the pupil, never was anything on earth so fine as his master’s eloquence; on this \\ntheme Marcus fairly bubbles over with enthusiasm. \\n73 “Well, if the ancient Greeks ever wrote anything like this, let those who know \\ndecide it: for me, if I dare say so, I never read any invective of Cato’s so fine as \\nyour encomium.

It is more difficult, he \\nadmits, to keep courtiers in harmony than to tame lions with a lute; but if it is to be \\ndone, it must be by eradicating jealousy. “Do not let your friends,” says Fronto,”77 \\n“envy each other, or think that what you give to another is filched from them. . . . \\nKeep away envy from your suite, and you will find your friends kindly and harmoni-\\nous.” \\nHere and there we meet with allusions to his daily life, which we could wish to be \\nmore frequent. He goes to the theatre or the law-courts,78 or takes part in court cer-\\nemony, but his heart is always with his books. The vintage season, with its religious \\nrites, was always spent by Antoninus Pius in the country. The following letters give \\nsonic notion of a day’s occupation at that time: \\n79 “MY DEAREST MASTER, — I am well. To-day I studied from the ninth hour of \\nthe night to the second hour of day, after taking food. I then put on my slip-\\npers, and from time second to the third hour had a most enjoyable walk up and \\ndown before my chamber. Then booted and cloaked — for so we were com-\\nmanded to appear — I went to wait upon my lord the emperor. We went a-\\nhunting, did doughty deeds, heard a rumour that boars had been caught, but \\nthere was nothing to see. However, we climbed a pretty steep hill, and in the af-\\nternoon returned home. I went straight to my books. Off with the boots, down \\nwith the cloak; I spent a couple of hours in bed. I read Cato’s speech on the \\nProperty of Pulchra, and another in which he impeaches a tribune. Ho, ho! I \\nhear you cry to your man, Off with you as fast as you can, and bring me these \\nspeeches from the library of Apollo. No use to send: I have those books with me \\ntoo. You must get round the Tiberian librarian; you will have to spend some-\\nthing on the matter; and when I return to town, I shall expect to go shares with \\nhim. Well, after reading these speeches I wrote a wretched trifle, destined for \\ndrowning or burning. No, indeed my attempt at writing did not come off at all \\nto-day; the composition of a hunter or a vintager, whose shouts are echoing \\nthrough my chamber, hateful and wearisome as the law-courts. What have I \\nsaid? Yes, it was rightly said, for my master is an orator. I think I have caught \\n                                            77 Ad M.

I slept a little more than usual for my slight \\ncold, which seems to be well again. So I spent the time from the eleventh hour \\nof the night to the third of the day partly in reading in Cato’s Agriculture, partly \\nin writing, not quite so badly as yesterday indeed. Then, after waiting upon my \\nfather, I soothed my throat with honey-water, ejecting it without swallowing: I \\nmight say gargle, but I won’t, though I think the word is found in Novius and \\nelsewhere. After attending to my throat I went to my father, and stood by his \\nside as he sacrificed. Then to luncheon. What do you think I had to eat? A bit of \\nbread so big, while I watched others gobbling boiled beans, onions, and fish full \\nof roe. Then we set to work at gathering the grapes, with plenty of sweat and \\nshouting, and, as the quotation runs, “A few high-hanging clusters did we leave \\nsurvivors of the vintage.” After the sixth hour we returned home. I did a little \\nwork, and poor work at that. Then I had a long gossip with my dear mother sit-\\nting on the bed. My conversation was: What do you think my friend Fronto is \\ndoing just now? She said: And what do you think of my friend Gratia?”80 My \\nturn now: “And what of our little Gratia,81 the sparrowkin? After this kind of \\ntalk, and an argument as to which of you loved the other most, the gong \\nsounded, the signal that my father had gone to the bath. We supped, after ab-\\nlutions in the oil-cellar — I mean we supped after ablutions, not after ablutions \\nin the oil-cellar; and listened with enjoyment to the rustics gibing. After return-\\ning, before turning on my side to snore, I do my task and give an account of the \\nday to my delightful master, whom if I could long for a little more, I should not \\nmind growing a trifle thinner. Farewell, Fronto, wherever you are, honey-sweet, \\nmy darling, my delight. Why do I want you? I can love you while far away.” \\nOne anecdote puts Marcus before us in a new light:82 \\n“When my father returned home from the vineyards, I mounted my horse as \\nusual, and rode on ahead some little way. Well, there on the road was a herd of \\nsheep, standing all crowded together as though the place were a desert, with \\nfour dogs and two shepherds, but nothing else. Then one shepherd said to an-\\nother shepherd, on seeing a number of horsemen: ‘I say,’ says he, ‘look you at \\nthose horsemen; they do a deal of robbery.’ When I heard this, I clap spurs to \\nmy horse, and ride straight for the sheep. In consternation the sheep scatter; \\nhither and thither they are fleeting and bleating. A shepherd throws his fork, \\nand the fork falls on the horseman who came next to me. We make our escape.” \\nWe like Marcus none the worse for this spice of mischief. \\n                                            80 Fronto’s wife. \\n81 Fronto’s daughter. \\n82 Ad M.

CÆSAR to his Master M. FRONTO, greeting. \\n“After I entered the carriage, after I took leave of you, we made a journey com-\\nfortable enough, but we had a few drops of rain to wet us. But before coming to \\nthe country-house, we broke our journey at Anagnia, a mile or so from the \\nhighroad. Then we inspected that ancient town, a miniature it is, but has in it \\nmany antiquities, temples, and religious ceremonies quite out of the way. There \\nis not a corner without its shrine, or fane, or temple; besides, many books writ-\\nten on linen, which belongs to things sacred. Then on the gate as we came out \\nwas written twice, as follows: ‘Priest don the fell.’84 I asked one of the inhabit-\\nants what that word was. He said it was the word in the Hernican dialect for \\nthe victim’s skin, which the priest puts over his conical cap when he enters the \\ncity. I found out many other things which I desired to know, but the only thing \\nI do not desire is that you should he absent from me; that is my chief anxiety. \\nNow for yourself, when you left that place, did you go to Aurelia or to Campa-\\nnia? Be sure to write to me, and say whether you have opened the vintage, or \\ncarried a host of books to the country-house; this also, whether you miss me; I \\nam foolish to ask it, whenas you tell it me of yourself. Now if you miss me and if \\nyou love me, send me your letters often, which is a comfort and consolation to \\nme. Indeed I should prefer ten times to read your letters than all the vines of \\nGaurus or the Marsians; for these Signian vines have grapes too rank and fruit \\ntoo sharp in the taste, but I prefer wine to must for drinking. Besides, those \\ngrapes are nicer to eat dried than fresh-ripe; I vow I would rather tread them \\nunder foot than put my teeth in them. But I pray they may be gracious and for-\\ngiving, and grant me free pardon for these jests of mine. Farewell, best friend, \\ndearest, most learned, sweetest master. When you see the must ferment in the \\nvat, remember that just so in my heart the longing for you is gushing and flow-\\ning and bubbling. Good-bye.” \\nMaking all allowances for conventional exaggerations, it is clear from the corre-\\nspondence that there was deep love between Marcus and his preceptor. The letters \\ncover several years in succession, but soon after the birth of Marcus’s daughter, \\nFaustina, there is a large gap. It does not follow that the letters ceased entirely, be-\\ncause we know part of the collection is lost; but there was probably less intercourse \\nbetween Marcus and Fronto after Marcus took to the study of philosophy under the \\nguidance of Rusticus. \\nWhen Marcus succeeded to the throne in 161, the letters begin again, with slightly \\nincreased formality on Fronto’s part, and they go on for some four years, when Fron-\\nto, who has been continually complaining of ill-health, appears to have died. One let-\\nter of the later period gives some interesting particulars of the emperor’s public life, \\n                                            83 Ad M.

Fronto speaks of Marcus’s victories and eloquence in the \\nusual strain of high praise, and then continues:85 \\n“The army when you took it in hand was sunk in luxury and revelry, and cor-\\nrupted with long inactivity. At Antiochia the soldiers had been Wont to applaud \\nat the stage plays, knew more of the gardens at the nearest restaurant than of \\nthe battlefield. Horses were hairy from lack of grooming, horsemen smooth be-\\ncause their hairs had been pulled out by the roots;86 a rare thing it was to see a \\nsoldier with hair on arm or leg. Moreover, they were better drest than armed; so \\nmuch so, that Laelianus Pontius. a strict man of the old discipline, broke the \\ncuirasses of some of them with his finger-tips, and observed cushions on the \\nhorses’ backs. At his direction the tufts were cut through, and out of the \\nhorsemen’s saddles came what appeared to be feathers pluckt from geese. Few \\nof the men could vault on horseback, the rest clambered up with difficulty by \\naid of heel and knee and leg not many could throw a lance hurtling, most did it \\nwithout force or power, as though they were things of wool. dicing was common \\nin the camp, sleep lasted all night, or if they kept watch it was over the wine-\\ncup. By what regulations to restrain such soldiers as these, and to turn them to \\nhonesty and industry, did you not learn from Hannibal’s sternness, the disci-\\npline of Africanus, the acts of Metellus recorded in history?” \\nAfter the preceptorial letters cease the others are concerned with domestic events, \\nhealth and sickness, visits or introductions, birth or death. Thus the emperor writes \\nto his old friend, who had shown some diffidence in seeking an interview:87 \\n“TO MY MASTER. \\n“I have a serious grievance against you, my dear master, yet indeed my grief is \\nmore than my grievance, because after so long a time I neither embraced you \\nnor spoke to you, though you visited the palace, and the moment after I had \\nleft the prince my brother. I reproached my brother severely for not recalling \\nme; nor durst he deny the fault.” \\nFronto again writes on one occasion: “I have seen your daughter. It was like seeing \\nyou and Faustina in infancy, so much that is charming her face has taken from each \\nof yours.” Or again, at a later date:88 \\n“I have seen your chicks, most delightful sight that ever I saw in my life, so like \\nyou that nothing is more like than the likeness. . . . By the mercy of Heaven \\nthey have a healthy colour and strong lungs. One held a piece of white bread, \\nlike a little prince, the other a common piece, like a true philosophers son.” \\nMarcus, we know, was devoted to his children. They were delicate in health, in spite \\nof Fronto’s assurance, and only one son survived the father. We find echoes of this \\naffection now and again in the letters. “We have summer heat here still,” writes Mar-\\ncus, “but since my little girls are pretty well, if I may say so, it is like the bracing cli-\\n                                            85 Ad Verum.

The poor old man suffered a heavy blow in \\nthe death of his grandson, on which Marcus writes:91 “I have just heard of your mis-\\nfortune. Feeling grieved as I do when one of your joints gives you pain, what do you \\nthink I feel, dear master, when you have pain of mind?” The old man’s reply, in spite \\nof a certain self-consciousness, is full of pathos. He recounts with pride the events of \\na long and upright life, in which he has wronged no man, and lived in harmony with \\nhis friends and family. His affectations fall away from him, as the cry of pain is \\nforced from his heart: \\n92 “Many such sorrows has fortune visited me with all my life long. To pass by \\nmy other afflictions, I have lost five children under the most pitiful conditions \\npossible: for the five I lost one by one when each was my only child, suffering \\nthese blows of bereavement in such a manner that each child was born to one \\nalready bereaved. Thus I ever lost my children without solace, and got them \\namidst fresh grief. . . . ” \\nThe letter continues with reflections on the nature of death, “more to be rejoiced at \\nthan bewailed, the younger one dies,” and an arraignment of Providence not without \\ndignity, wrung from him as it were by this last culminating misfortune. It concludes \\nwith a summing-up of his life in protest against the blow which has fallen on his grey \\nhead: \\n“Through my long life I have committed nothing which might bring dishonour, \\nor disgrace, or shame: no deed of avarice or treachery have I done in all my \\nday’s: nay, but much generosity, much kindness, much truth and faithfulness \\nhave I shown, often at the risk of my own life. I have lived in amity with my \\ngood brother, whom I rejoice to see in possession of the highest office by your \\nfather’s goodness, and by your friendship at peace and perfect rest. The offices \\nwhich I have myself obtained I never strove for by any underhand means. I \\nhave cultivated my mind rather than my body; the pursuit of learning I have \\npreferred to increasing my wealth. I preferred to he poor rather than bound by \\nany man’s obligation, even to want rather than to beg. I have never been ex-\\ntravagant in spending money, I have earned it sometimes because I must. I \\nhave scrupulously spoken the truth, and have been glad to hear it spoken to \\nme. I have thought it better to be neglected than to fawn, to be dumb than to \\nfeign, to be seldom a friend than to be often a flatterer. 1 have sought little, de-\\nserved not little. So far as I could, I have assisted each according to my means. \\nI have given help readily to the deserving, fearlessly to the undeserving. No one \\nby proving to be ungrateful has made me more slow to bestow promptly all \\nbenefits I could give, nor have I ever been harsh to ingratitude.
